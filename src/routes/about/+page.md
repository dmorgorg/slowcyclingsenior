## About me:

For the TL;DR, just read the above. Otherwise...

Born and schooled in the UK. Notable for the amount of time spent at the University of Sheffield, in the '70s, and still leaving without a degree. During one of my 'study breaks,' I hitch-hiked to Greece, then took buses and trains overland to India and Nepal. So started a long-lived fascination with India (now somewhat reduced &ndash; very hot, very polluted and I find the way the noisy nouveau middle-class, and their obnoxious overfed spoiled offspring, treat those less fortunate than themselves quite disappointing). Not to say that I shan't return: rural India still appeals.

Since my mid-teens, my life had been defined pretty much by rock-climbing. I had never been successful at sports but showed aptitude for climbing - and found it thrilling. My choice of Sheffield for university was strongly influenced by ready access to the Peak District National Park and it's wonderful gritstone and limestone crags. I never let lecture attendance get in the way of my climbing - much to the concern of my parents.

With my university career behind me, I headed over to the US (1978) with a couple of climbing friends. We bought a car in New York, climbed a bit, drove to Colorado and climbed around Boulder, then climbed in Utah and California. At the end of our trip, we went our separate ways; I headed north to Calgary in Canada, feeling little pull back to the UK. And I've been based in Canada ever since.

I met a lovely woman with a love for travel, and continued to travel. We married and had a family (one daughter, one son). I had been working in construction, as a carpenter, but as the children started school and we could no longer disappear for the winters, I decided it was time for a change and returned to university, this time in Calgary. I graduated and taught at a polytechnic for fifteen years before retiring.

Swapping from life as a carpenter to being a student was good for my back. Not so much for my front. I continued to eat like a construction worker and grew too heavy to climb. Biking, specifically touring, seemed a good new direction. I had done one extended cycle tour back in the early 90s, before our children were born, in southern India. At 60, it was time to see whether cycle touring still worked for me. In the fall of 2012, I cycled from Darjeeling, in the north-east of India, to Kanniya Kumari at the southern tip of the sub-continent. Yes, it was still fun (much of the time) and a great way to travel. And a bit of exercise didn't hurt, either. (Well, sometimes it did &ndash; literally &ndash; hurt. But the exercise was good for me!)

The focus of this site is my travels since arriving in Darjeeling a month or two into my sixties. But it will be a long time before it is up to date. But I'll try to keep the new stuff coming, and add to the old stuff when time allows.

## About this site:

In the year 2000 I was studying computer science and started a website: <code>dmorg.org</code>. (I don't remember so can only surmise that <code>dm.org</code> was already taken.) Over time, <code>dmorg.org</code> morphed into large, unwieldy Wordpress site for documenting my travels. When Covid interrupted all our travels, instead of fixing the many niggling issues with my Wordpress site, I focused on other, more satisfying hobby-coding projects. Back on the bike in 2022, riding from London to Prague with my lovely wife, I documented the ride on Blogger (https://dmorgorg.blogspot.com). I enjoyed this because the Blogger app made it easy to make minor updates from my phone. I may have forgotten this when I started <code>https://slowcyclingsenior.ca</code> as a fresh Wordpress site for this year's trek.

And then my hosting plan came up for its renewal. $340 for a year. **Whoa!** Hosting plans often offer cheap starter rates but I'm long past those on my otherwise excellent service provider. I'm sure I didn't pay anything like this annual fee for my last triannual renewal. Anyway, it's way too much for this retiree's blogs and hobby sites. Especially as I've migrated all but one of my hobby sites to a different technology which I can host for free. Really, all I need the hosting for is Wordpress. And not really for that when Blogger is available.

But I've been interested for a while in static sites (no dynamic content, every visitor sees the same pages) which I can code myself, which are faster, and don't require a database. Using JavaScript rather than Wordpress' PHP code. (There is one drawback; I can't implement an efficient comment functionality.)

So this is a 'static site,' coded using a JavaScript compiler called Sveltekit (which is an absolute joy). Posts are written in Markdown. It is hosted for <code>vercel.com</code>. Now everything is free/open source &ndash; except for my photo processing which requires paid software (DxO Photolab, Adobe Lightroom).

Now, the time-consuming task of transferring ten or more years of posts from two Wordpress sites and one Blogger site. Something to keep me out of trouble for a while. I don't anticipate completion any time soon; my other projects are a distraction. And I do go on trips now and again!

(At time of writing &ndash; 29th December, 2023 &ndash; I am heading off for a few months in Sri Lanka, back to my Mum's for a couple of weeks, then off for a couple of months in Spain.)
