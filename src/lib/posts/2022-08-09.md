  <br /> Hook of Holland to den Haag, Zuid-Holland 
  <p>We spilled off the ferry, somewhat bleary-eyed, at 0700 English time after a short but comfortable night. We'd had a meal after the ferry got under way at 2300 and we're in bed before 0100. An announcement that breakfast was being served came much too early at 0530 and was ignored but there was no getting back to sleep.</p>
  <p>After a while, our phones recognised that we were in a different country and connected us to the local network. We decided that den Haag/The Hague was a suitable destination for our first day on the continent, and off we wobbled. Beautifully wide cycle paths led us out of the Hook of Holland and northward. After playing in the traffic in England, this felt like a different planet. Bikes everywhere. Mostly passing us. More than half were electric. We mostly followed the coast route (LF Kustroute, also part of EV12) before heading off route into town.</p>

  <p>After settling into our hotel, we went for a wander around in search of dinner. A hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant exceeded all expectations. So far, we're pretty happy with the Netherlands.</p>

  <br />Romford to Chelmsford, Essex
  <p>Three days should have been easy to Harwich but we hadn't made much progress on the first day so we'd have a couple of long days to make the ferry. But, as luck would have it, a berth had come free on the night after our booking and we were able to switch easily. Pressure off. And a nicer cabin, with a window, which Bev felt would ameliorate her sea-sickness. (The crossing was totally smooth, courtesy of flat seas and modern ship stabiliser technology; we hardly knew we were at sea.)</p>
  <p>The further we made it from London, the more the scenery improved. Still almost totally urban but hints of countryside. But it was hardly a ride I'd recommend; too much traffic and, for us, the navigation still entertaining. But we made some progress, despite the heat. We were aiming for a hotel on the far side of Chelmsford but, when we arrived, the last room had just disappeared. We had to retrace our route back into town to a hotel with delusions of grandeur. Which it didn't quite pull off. But we had somewhere comfortable enough to sleep on a busy Friday night in the height of summer.</p>
