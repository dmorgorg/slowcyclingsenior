  <h5>
  	April 30th, 2023
  	<br /> Chartres to Chateaudun
  </h5>
  (57.7 km, 336m, 502.8 km to date)
  
 <p> The riding day began with an uphill to Aldi, and a restocking of lunchtime favourites. Then, vaguely steering by the sun, I made a somewhat meandering path to rejoin my route.</p>

 <p> A lovely day with me feeling much refreshed by my rest day. Typically unspoiled countryside, minimal traffic, pleasant weather and a short but not unpleasant detour from tarmac onto a forestry track.</p>
  
  <img alt="Forestry trail detour" src="/images/2023/04/phone/20230430_1712.jpg" />
  
 <p> A late 13th century church in Bonneval (Eglise Notre Dame) provided a welcome excuse to bring out the camera and explore further. Again, beautiful stained glass work. A typical hodge-podge of styles with some windows reminiscent of the "secondary Romanesque style of the end of the 12th century." Gables from the 16th century, main altar from 1895, and stained glass between 1871 and 1893.</p>

<p>  Then I seemed to hit a wall. Energy deserted me for no apparent reason (except, perhaps, opting for a succession of Nougatti chocolate bars rather than stopping for a more substantial bread and Laughing Cow cheese for lunch?).</p>
  
<p>  I pedalled slowly into Chateaudun, where I found, to my consternation, that my inReach communicator had stopped tracking in Bonneval. Why? All I could think of was that some kids hanging around outside the church had expressed some interest in the device and had interfered with the settings. I did leave my bike unattended with the inReach accessible while I darted into the church but, to be fair, I have no evidence that anyone touched anything. I would rather that they had than consider that this expensive piece of kit was occasionally unreliable.</p>
  
  <img alt="Road sign indicating cycle route and camino" src="/images/2023/04/phone/20230430_1544.jpg" />
  
 <p> In addition to signs indicating the cycle route I’m on, since Chartres there have been camino shell signs also. It’s nice to see them, and a bit of a surprise to see them so early.</p>
  
 <p> The Baobar hotel was cheap, and measured up to those expectations. It seemed deserted, which is not surprising: many of the French hotels had seemed spookily empty. Narrow winding staircases led to long, narrow gloomy corridors. I wondered what wandered these corridors in the dead of night. Then, the shutter on the window in my room didn’t respond to my turning the handle. I tried it in the other direction, and the shutter housing above the window exploded. I almost caught the detached face of the shutter housing but, more importantly, avoided serious (or, in fact, any) injury. A dark evening in the room was now inevitable.</p>
  
  Showered and shaved (yes, the beard is gone for now, a long process with a disposable razor), I headed back to the Royal Punjab that I had noticed on the way into town. It was just a few hundred metres. The food was good, the lime pickle delicious.

  <h5>
  	May 1st, 2023
  	<br /> Chateaudun to Saint Ouen, Centre-Val de Loire
  </h5>
  (57.7 km, 336m, 558.8 km to date)

<p>  Breakfast was poor. Minimal. Not a huge surprise. Some bread and jam, some pain-de-chocolate and commercial fruit salad. Most seriously, though, was my missing the small print on the coffee machine and drinking decaf!</p>
  
 <p> On my way down to the lobby to check out, I met Chris, also carrying Ortlieb panniers. More than I had! Yes, I am not actually the most heavily-laden cycle tourist in this part of the world. Chris, from Antwerp and recently retired, had a bike and trailer, the trailer for his dog. An Airedale terrier, I think. Chris and I were on the same route, to Compostela de Santiago, but Chris was only going as far as Saint Jean Pied-de-Port (the usual start of the Camino Frances) this year.</p>
  
<p>  We had a bit of a dilemma: there was no-one to open the door to let us out. This was less of a problem for me; I could just roll out of the front door. But Chris’ bike and trailer were located between two locked glass doors, in full view but totally inaccessible. The cleaning staff (of one) didn’t have a key so Chris was, temporarily, stuck.</p>
  
<p>  I rolled out of the hotel and into a busier than usual day in the centre of town, it being May 1st. Much of the local gendarmerie were in evidence, too; maybe France has a history of protests on this day? Or, perhaps, it was just an abundance of caution since the populace were fairly dissatisfied with the raising of the pension/retirement age from 62 to 64, just pushed through by Macron.</p>
<p>
    
    I took the time to do a little sight-seeing in the medieval part of town. Very picturesque!

<p>  Whilst moving my bike from its resting place after my photo session, a pannier caught on a bench. I was astride the bike, walking it clear of the bench, when the pannier caught. And I went over. A combination of a heavy bike and weak ankle (I’ve had a stubborn sprained ankle, weak and painful to walk on, for a couple of months now; fortunately, cycling only tires it and it does recover some overnight) had me hitting the cobbles pretty hard. They don't give much at all. No harm done, I thought, and carried on, steeply downhill and out of town.</p>
  
  <img alt="Chateau along road" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-01-112815.jpg" />
  <img alt="Chateau along road" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-01-112828.jpg" />

<p>  Today wasn’t as pleasing as yesterday but that may have been just my perception. I shouldn’t have felt as tired as I did. But it was heavy plodding.</p>
  
<p>  I took another tumble when putting my foot down (the ‘good’ foot this time, not the one with the sprained) into grass by a picnic table where I was stopping for lunch. Fortunately, I still had my helmet on because there was a big thump on the back of my head. Just one of those days, I hoped! It was here that I also discovered the key to my room from the previous night in my pocket. The ‘escape’ from the hotel had been a bit shambolic; that’s my excuse, anyway.</p>
  
<p>  Chris rolled in to where I had stopped for lunch at a picnic spot, having made his own escape eventually. We chatted a little, he ate a quick lunch, and was back on the road before me. Maybe our paths would cross again.</p>

 <p> Wide open farming vistas that, in retrospect, look quite pleasant. </p>

      Over these few days, there was a gradual shift in the countryside I was riding through. Slowly, the magical emptiness of the landscape diminished and there was a feeling of more people around, more dwellings dotting the hillsides. The roads were busier, too, although not to the point of being an issue for me. The vibrant yellow canola field were less common and those that they were did not look as bright – maybe less rain?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain fluidity in the reporting of distances, this sign suggesting 1447 km to Compostela de Santiago. My route calculations are closer to 1700 km. A sign I passed a couple of hours later would have me believe I had covered about 150 km in that time. By my reckoning, it is about 900 km to Pamplona where I hope to meet Bev in about two weeks! I will have to cut a few corners on this meandering route.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed, then criss-crossed, Le Loir for a while before arriving at La Loire, a much more impressive flow of water, at Tours. La Loire is the river we had ridden along before Covid. More descents and climbs as I crossed more minor river valleys, and then I rode along La Vienne for a while until I arrived in Civaux last night.
