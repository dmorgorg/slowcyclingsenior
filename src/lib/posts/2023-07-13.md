  Just a ride from the hotel to the train station in Ferrol, then from the station in Ribadeo to my hotel. Then, realising that I had left my passport in the hotel in Ferrol, back to the train station in Ribadeo for the second train journey of the day between Ferrol and Ribadeo, ride to the hotel, pick up passport, back to the station and the third ride of the day, back to Ribadeo. And the final ride to the hotel. Silly boy.

    <br />Ribadeo, Galicia
   </h5>
   <p>Rather than wait for my ferry in Bilbao, I decided to spend the couple of days in Ribadeo.  My hotel was pleasant enough and well-situated for a stroll/hobble down town. A laundry to get some clothes clean again. Nice restaurants. And access to 'the Beach of the Cathedrals' natural monument (which we had missed on our earlier passage through Ribadeo on the Camino del Norte).</p>
   <p>I had to reserve a place to get access to the beach (necessary at Easter and from the beginning of July until the end of September); it was limited to 4812 visitors (!) daily. Admission is free but controlled. And why exactly 4812?</p>
   <p>I caught the Feve train 10 km back west to the country station &ndash; which was just a platform &ndash; and then had a bit of a walk to the beach access where there was a line up of people queuing to show their reservations and passports! So many people, unlike just about every beach I had seen in Spain.</p>
