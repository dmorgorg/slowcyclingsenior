  <h5>
    Jun 24th, 2023
    <br /> Santiago de Compostela to Negreira, Galicia
   </h5>(23.1km, 404m, 2499.1 km to date)   
  
  <p>Bev’s taxi arrived on time and she was whisked away to the airport at 8:30, leaving me feeling a bit lost. The Camino is over. And I’m on my own again. Without much of an objective. Mainly, ride to Finisterre and Muxia, Caminos in their own right, then head back east towards Bilbao where I have a ferry on the eleventh of July.</p>

  <p>It had already felt hot when I popped out on to the street at 8:30. Still so at 11:00 when I set off, having slowly packed my stuff and retrieved my bike from the basement. I picked up bread at Dia, the supermercado, and wheeled my belongings down the cobbled Rua San Pedro, against the one-way traffic. Had I paid more attention to my routing, I could have taken an adjacent road and ridden but, by the time I noticed, I didn’t feel like backtracking.</p>

  <p>Lots of downhill out of the city: elevation loss that will cost me dearly later on. A mix of countryside and urbanity, and toasty. I stopped in the shade regularly. Then I stopped at a café for coffee, not having had my morning Joe, but decided on a Radler (beer and lemon juice) since the Radler tap was just staring at me. Then, a bit of an incident. I handed over ten for the beer and received nine in change. Wow, cheap, I thought. I went for a pee and saw that I was extremely dehydrated so had another beer (the Radler is very low alcohol) and left €2 to cover payment and a tip. I was leaving when the barman shouted across the road and called me back; I hadn’t paid enough. So, I explained what had happened, that the barman had given me too much change and I thought I had left plenty. I handed over another €2 and all was good.</p>

  <p>(I figured it all out later, despite the heat of the afternoon: the barman had returned two one-Euro coins to me, which I had mistaken for two-Euro coins. The Radler cost €3 each and I had left €1 on the bar to pay for my second. My very bad.)</p>

  <p>Except the hill that started immediately. The sign warned of 10% grades for 2km and it was on gravel, slippery under foot. I tried to ride but didn’t get far. I tried to push and didn’t get much further. It was one o’clock, and 31 degrees Celsius, and not a cloud in the sky. Slowly, I pushed between shade trees making very slow progress. A kind Frenchman helped with the pushing for a while but it was more awkward and not much assistance. Several passing walkers enquired about my well-being as they passed me motionless in the shade.</p>

  <p>I saw an arrow pointed left to tarmac, signed Eurovelo 3, and I took it even though it disagreed with my gpx track. Why, I wondered, didn’t the EV3 take the road all the way and avoid the gravel if it was going to bail halfway anyway? Slowly, slowly, up. I rode short sections (my legs don’t have it!) and then pushed until the slope lessened for a while and I could get started again. But it was brutal. Hot even in the shade. No breeze. Just eucalyptus trees swaying ever so gently and creaking.</p>

  <p>I did reach the top, eventually, and continued on through a more rural setting. Over an old bridge. Along bumpy stone roads. And, eventually, into Negreira. A short day in terms of distance but it just about did me in. It seemed that my age, the heat, my excessive weight and sprained ankle all conspired against me today. And I was back on my own.</p>
