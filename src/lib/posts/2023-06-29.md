  <h5>Camino Finisterre</h5>
  <p><i>'Finis terrea' is Latin for 'the end of the world.'</i></p>
  <p>There are many caminos: 59 (officially) recognised in Spain and 9 <i>caminhos</i> is Portugal. The most popular, the Camino Franc&eacute;s, starts just over the Spanish border, at St Jean Pied-de-Port in France, and follows a route 779 km (according to my recently earned Certificate of Distance) long to the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia. Most caminos terminate in Santiago.</p>

  <p>The Camino Finisterre is a short (90 km) trail that starts in Santiago and ends in Cape Fisterra (or Muxia to the North) on the Costa da Morte. The route was established before Christianity as pagans travelled to the coast where the sun died and the worlds of the dead and the living grew closer. </p>

    Jun 24th, 2023
    <br /> Santiago de Compostela to Negreira, Galicia
   </h5>(23.1km, 404m, 2499.1 km to date)   
  
  <p>Bev’s taxi arrived on time and she was whisked away to the airport at 8:30, leaving me feeling a bit lost. The Camino is over. And I’m on my own again. Without much of an objective. Mainly, ride to Finisterre and Muxia, Caminos in their own right, then head back east towards Bilbao where I have a ferry on the eleventh of July.</p>

  <p>It had already felt hot when I popped out on to the street at 8:30. Still so at 11:00 when I set off, having slowly packed my stuff and retrieved my bike from the basement. I picked up bread at Dia, the supermercado, and wheeled my belongings down the cobbled Rua San Pedro, against the one-way traffic. Had I paid more attention to my routing, I could have taken an adjacent road and ridden but, by the time I noticed, I didn’t feel like backtracking.</p>

  <p>Lots of downhill out of the city: elevation loss that will cost me dearly later on. A mix of countryside and urbanity, and toasty. I stopped in the shade regularly. Then I stopped at a café for coffee, not having had my morning Joe, but decided on a Radler (beer and lemon juice) since the Radler tap was just staring at me. Then, a bit of an incident. I handed over ten for the beer and received nine in change. Wow, cheap, I thought. I went for a pee and saw that I was extremely dehydrated so had another beer (the Radler is very low alcohol) and left €2 to cover payment and a tip. I was leaving when the barman shouted across the road and called me back; I hadn’t paid enough. So, I explained what had happened, that the barman had given me too much change and I thought I had left plenty. I handed over another €2 and all was good.</p>

  <p>(I figured it all out later, despite the heat of the afternoon: the barman had returned two one-Euro coins to me, which I had mistaken for two-Euro coins. The Radler cost €3 each and I had left €1 on the bar to pay for my second. My very bad.)</p>

  <p>Except the hill that started immediately. The sign warned of 10% grades for 2km and it was on gravel, slippery under foot. I tried to ride but didn’t get far. I tried to push and didn’t get much further. It was one o’clock, and 31 degrees Celsius, and not a cloud in the sky. Slowly, I pushed between shade trees making very slow progress. A kind Frenchman helped with the pushing for a while but it was more awkward and not much assistance. Several passing walkers enquired about my well-being as they passed me motionless in the shade.</p>

  <p>I saw an arrow pointed left to tarmac, signed Eurovelo 3, and I took it even though it disagreed with my gpx track. Why, I wondered, didn’t the EV3 take the road all the way and avoid the gravel if it was going to bail halfway anyway? Slowly, slowly, up. I rode short sections (my legs don’t have it!) and then pushed until the slope lessened for a while and I could get started again. But it was brutal. Hot even in the shade. No breeze. Just eucalyptus trees swaying ever so gently and creaking.</p>

  <div class="caption">Ponte Maceira</div>

  <p>I did reach the top, eventually, and continued on through a more rural setting. Over an old bridge. Along bumpy stone roads. And, eventually, into Negreira. A short day in terms of distance but it just about did me in. It seemed that my age, the heat, my excessive weight and sprained ankle all conspired against me today. Everything was a little harder because I was back on my own.</p>

    <br /> Negreira to Olveiroa, Galicia
   </h5>(33.0 km, 638 m, 2532.1 km to date)   
  <p>Chalk and cheese, yesterday and today. Not that today was a pushover (well, it was in places, literally). The temperature was lower, there was shade and occasional breeze, the hills were not so brutal. Or that’s how it felt. It might just have been that I wasn’t having a good day yesterday, but I certainly wasn’t the only one feeling the heat.</p>
  <div class="w-80"><img alt="camino finisterre" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-25-103053.jpg" /></div>
  <p>Downhill out of town, then up on a rocky track through trees. I rode very little of it before being forced off to push. It wasn’t extremely steep so pushing was relaxed, a pleasant stroll in the woods before the heat of the day. Slow going, as usual. More than three hours for the first twelve or so kilometres. Including many breaks. But it felt relaxing, rather than the unpleasantness of yesterday. I rode bits, and enjoyed them. I pushed more, and enjoyed that as well. Chalk and cheese indeed!</p>

  <img alt="camino finisterre" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-25-112136.jpg" />
  <p>Then out of the shaded pathways and into more open country. Crops of corn, rolling hills, wind turbines on the ridges. Played leapfrog with walking pilgrim’s, with them often passing me whilst I rested from pushing on uphills. 50% more elevation gain than yesterday, over 600m, but somehow less wearing.</p>

  <p>I made it to Oliveiroa after 3:30 and decided not to check the first albergue I saw. It might have been fine but the rooms were only a few euros more than the dorms (€20 vs €12) so I suspected they may have been somewhat lacking. Or all snatched up by those tired of bunking. Instead, Casa Loncho has beautiful rooms for €45, a good restaurant and a nice vibe. Too bad I’m not due a rest day; this wouldn’t be a hard place to hang out. ></p>
  <p>My rear brake had been squealing so I did some adjustments and then decided to add sealant to the front wheel. Probably a good move since the rear had been dry when I had the spoke replaced in the rear wheel. Hopefully the tyre will still be inflated in the morning!</p>

  <p>The tyre was fine!</p>
  <p>I was all ready to leave. Bags packed. Bike retrieved from the garage where it had spent a peaceful night snuggling against a friendly tractor. And I thought: “This place is nice. Relaxing. I’m not in a rush.”</p>
  <p>I extended my room for a second night. No guilt.</p>

  <p>These raised granaries, h&oacute;rreos, are stores for crops such as maize. Well ventilated by slots in the walls, they also protect against humidity. The pillars, with their large flat tops, are a barrier for rodents.</p>

  <p>I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast on the patio of the albergue restaurant. The proprietress laughed, and asked whether I was staying for (yet?) another day. It would have been very pleasant... But no, time to ride on.</p>

  <p>I wandered around about for a while, then rode out to the cape. A steep climb but without panniers and with a helping tailwind, it was almost a pleasure. At the cape (nothing special), I took advantage of an unladen bike to tune up the brakes. Again. Then the ride back down to town required, in places, some pedalling to combat the headwind.</p>

  <p>So much for an early start but nothing new on that score. I managed to get bread at the supermarket just up the road from the hotel but the World Family was again closed in the morning, with the same old note in the window promising opening at 7:00 pm. Which was too late for breakfast, even for me. It was actually raining lightly as I went for the bread and I could feel the drops through my sun shirt. It didn’t last long at all.</p>
  <p>Back to the hotel for ham on toast, jam on toast, coffee and orange. And then on the road. Some up, some down, not much level going. Tarmac to start, then trail. Relaxed feel to the day since it didn’t seem like I had too far to go. Pootling along…</p>

  <p>A little village with no signs of life; does anyone live here? Views of the sea, and then dropped some hard-gained elevation down to pass a beautiful deserted beach. There was no obvious access so I carried on. Uphill, of course, after being at sea-level. Slow going, bottom gearing, grinding it out.</p>

  <p>After some road work, the camino headed up a bumpy track (there had been some ugly bumpy track work earlier). Probably to a fine view point from the wind turbines. But the direct route to Finisterre showed 11 metres of climbing, the Camino 69 metres, so the road it was.</p>
