  	  May 22nd, 2023
  	  <br /> Around Saint Jean Pied-de-Port
    </h5>
    (39.6 km, 390 m, 1134.8 km to date)
    <img alt="Comfortable place to stay" src="/images/2023/05/phone/20230523_114116968.jpg" />
  <p> A pretty frustrating day, off to the Parc Arroday early and hanging out there for hours trying to figure out the issue with the booking. Apparently the hotel doesn’t take reservations after 6:00 pm (mine was a couple of minutes shy of 7:00 pm) so no email was sent to me with a code to get details of a non-existent reservation. To be fair, Veronique at reception tried very hard. I was finally able to get into a room in the early afternoon but no news about whether I get a refund on my booking (which didn’t exist) for the first day.</p>

<Callout> No refund was forthcoming. Despite not recognising my booking because it was made too late - even though the website I was using accepted my booking - and although I did not get to sleep at the Parc Arroday, I was denied a refund. For the booking that didn't exist and for the room that was not booked. <strong>Do not give this place the benefit of your business!</strong>

  	  May 14th, 2023
  	  <br /> La Réole to Damazan, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (50.3 km, 390 m, 1185.1 km to date)
    <p>I retraced my steps into La Réole and up a steep hill to find the boulangerie. Sunday morning! Then stopped at a café for a coffee. It was noon and many of the clientele were settled into their first quantity of wine for the day. I stayed with my café crème although it would have been very pleasant to adopt some of the local culture and spend a lazy afternoon sipping wine and reading a book. My coffee was pretty good but not really a substitute.</p>
    <p>After a short while riding, I was on a path alongside the Canal de Garonne. The “Le Canal des Deux-Mers” refers to this canal, and the next: le Canal du Midi which link the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. Little if any traffic on the canal, a handful at most of pleasure craft all day. And I followed the canal all day.</p>
    <p>I was pausing to take a photograph when I heard a couple behind me talking in English, an older lady and (I presume) her daughter, also on bikes. We chatted; they are from New Zealand and are cycling the canal trail. I didn’t get full details of their trip but did learn (I asked!) that the mother is eighty-six! Full of sparkle. They had rented e-bikes for the journey.</p>

    <div class="caption">Eighty-six year old mother in the lead (in blue)!</div>
    <p>It was very pretty, very green and very calming. I sat by a lock to have brunch (I had only had a handful of bread torn off the loaf I’d bought in the morning and had been looking for somewhere to sit and eat).</p>

    <img alt="canal riding" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-14-191708.jpg" />
    <p>A warmer day, with sunshine. Easy riding but I feel a rest day (physical and mental) coming on. I don’t have much spare time, if any, to get to Pamplona by the time that Bev arrives but I also sense that I am grinding to a halt. Hopefully a rest day can fix that. There looks to be a reasonable hotel in Damazan…</p>

  	  May 16th, 2023
  	  <br /> Damazan to Cazaubon, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (76.6 km, 655 m, 1261.7 km to date)
    <p>Things are starting to blur: writing this on the 19th, I can recall no details of the rest day in Damozan. Or of Damozan itself. I need to take more pictures as memory-joggers. But the rest day can’t have done me any harm; this is probably my best day yet in terms of progress.</p>
    <p>It started with a further quiet 9 kilometres along the canal before breaking off southwards across country. Wooded countryside and more hills than seems absolutely necessary – the very flat north of France has spoiled me. My knees seem to be standing up to the hills, apart from the odd painful twinge. We’ll see whether the Pyrenees make the case for a new pair of knees.</p>
    <img alt="one of many historical buildings" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-16-123425.jpg" />
    <p>Then about 20 km of double track, presumably an old railway line that has not been ‘upgraded’ to tarmac. More pleasant, by far, despite making progress a little harder. I was held up a little initially by a large group of seniors out on a guided nature ramble of some sort who encouraged me in that most French of ways: “Allez, allez!” It was fun and brought a smile to my face.</p>
    <img alt="off road riding." src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-16-132045.jpg" />
    <p>For the most part, the trail was dry. My almost-slick tyres are not so good in the mud so I wheeled around some stretches that offered the opportunity for a mud-splattering face-plant.</p>

  	  <br /> Cazaubon to Mont de Marsan, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (51.4 km, 85 m, 1313.1 km to date)
     <p>I've been having a bit of a mechanical issue. After lunch yesterday, I noticed slack in one crank arm. I tightened up the 'pinch' bolts and rode on. It seemed to be a fix.</p>
    <img alt="off road riding." src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-17-133314.jpg" />
    <p>Only a temporary fix, however. The problem quickly returned and repeated tightening only gave a few hundred metres of relief. Pedalling is inefficient, to say the least. At the top of each pedal stroke, on the right side, the pedal slips forward about one-sixth of a revolution (10 mins on an analogue clock!). I need to find a bike-shop although they are not in much evidence hereabouts.</p>

  	  <br /> Mont de Marsan to Dax, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (74.8 km, 436 m, 1387.9 km to date)
    <p>I headed first to a bike repair that wasn’t too far off my route. I didn’t know who would be open today, it being Ascension Day and any reason is reason enough to have a holiday in France, and those that were open might be on Sunday hours (that is, open from nine to noon only). Google took me to a quiet suburban subdivision, a locked gate and a warning “Attention aux chien.” I looked over the gate and saw a bicycle stand and some tools under a shelter so I was at the right place. But no-one answered the bell, no dog barked, and I had made a fruitless trip.</p>
    <p>Next, on to Decathlon. The lads there were helpful, but no real help. By now it was 1:00 pm and I’d better get on with the day.</p>
    <img alt="another pastoral scene" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-18-150641.jpg" />
    <p>Pleasant enough riding but I was feeling a bit tired and a little concerned about both my bike and getting to Pamplona in time for my rendezvous with Bev.</p>
    <img alt="humorously decorated utility panel box at the roadside" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-18-162323.jpg" />
    <p>Partway through the afternoon, feeling quite tender on the saddle, I decided a day in Dax might be a good idea. Some rest, and I could spend the day chasing solutions for the crank problem</p>
    <p>Not a bad day considering the late start.</p>

   <h5>
  	  May 19th, 2023
  	  <br /> Around Dax, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (9.4 km, 53 m, 1397.3 km to date)
    <p>A day dedicated to bike repair; it’s much easier getting around town with an unloaded bike, which isn’t possible if I’ve already checked out of a hotel. As I found out yesterday, heading out for the day’s ride after checking out a few bike shops is not conducive to a productive day in the saddle! (Although yesterday was pretty good considering the late start, mentally it wasn't so good. And I am doing this to have a good time. I think...</p>
    <img alt="hotel room view" src="/images/2023/05/phone/20230518_2048.jpg" />
    <div class="caption">A (hotel) room with a view</div>
    <p>First stop was at Atelier Sabotage. What’s in a name? I rode past it a couple of times, trying to locate it. I didn’t realise I should have been looking for a tattoo parlour. The proprietor/tattooist looked at my bike, hummed and hawed, admitted that he wasn’t really a bike specialist and sent me to Decathlon.</p>
    <p>So, off to Decathlon I rode. Second stop. Two mechanics looked at the bike for a while before deciding (correctly) that it needed a new crank. Which the mechanic at Giant Dax would have, they were sure. Mmm.</p>
    <img alt="shuttered windows view" src="/images/2023/05/phone/20230519_1335.jpg" />
    <div class="caption">The view across the road, waiting outside Giant Dax</div>
    <p>Third stop was at Giant Dax. I arrived a few minutes after noon and they were closed for lunch, until two. So I just waited.</p> 
    <p>A quick look at the bike and the mechanic was hopeful he had a crank that would fit: for some reason, it would have be a left side crank, which would mean a left pedal, but it would be rideable. Interesting. But, as it happens, non of his cranks, left or right, would fit. (I had assumed he had Pinion cranks but was confused why I’d need the left one. It turns out we were both confused.) If I got a crank, he could install it… Maybe so could I. But he had managed to remove the crank which was good – and I got him to put it back on so I could at least ride the bike.</p>
    <p>bike24.de has the cranks and estimate one to three working days for delivery within Germany. Not so good. I contacted Olsen Bikes in the UK, a Pinion/Gates/titanium small operation (Steven Olsen), he had some cranks and popped a pair in the mail to Bev in Greenwich virtually right away. Great service. Now I just have to get myself and my bike to Pamplona to meet Bev and the cranks.</p>
    <p>Progress, of sorts.</p>

    (66.5 km, 718 m, 1463.8 km to date)
    <p>I don't recall much of this day. Presumably just another day of cycling through the deserted countryside, with the handicap of a floppy pedal. </p>

    <p>And I have arrived at the start of the Camino. It should be a cause for celebration but...</p>
    <p>I booked Parc Arroday for the night and rode out of town a little way to check in. But there was no-one there to let me in. A guest wandered by and tried, unsuccessfully, to help me. A couple of frustrating hours passed and I eventually went off to find alternative accommodation. Saint Jean Pied-de-Port is definitely geared up for the regular onslaught of peregrinos, more commercial than anywhere yet, and I was not particularly happy to have to pay twice for one night's rest.</p>
    <p>On a more positive note: the hostess at the second place was wonderful and I also met a cyclist, Leroy, who had ridden down from the Netherlands. He had started with his father who had, unfortunately, bailed on his long-time ambition, preoccupied by work concerns and not mentally prepared for the ride. Leroy and I had a pleasant evening meal, and bottle of wine, together. </p>
