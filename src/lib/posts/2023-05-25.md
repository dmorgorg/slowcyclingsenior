  	  <br /> Around Saint Jean Pied-de-Port

  <p> A pretty frustrating day, off to the Parc Arroday early and hanging out there for hours trying to figure out the issue with the booking. Apparently the hotel doesnâ€™t take reservations after 6:00 pm (mine was a couple of minutes shy of 7:00 pm) so no email was sent to me with a code to get details of a non-existent reservation. To be fair, Veronique at reception tried very hard. I was finally able to get into a room in the early afternoon but no news about whether I get a refund on my booking (which didnâ€™t exist) for the first night.</p>
    <Callout> <strong>No refund was forthcoming!</strong> Despite not recognising my booking &ndash; and payment &ndash; because it was made too late &ndash; even though their associate website accepted my booking &ndash; and although I did not get access to a room at the Parc Arroday, I was denied a refund. For the booking that didn't exist and for the room that was not booked. <br/><strong>Bear this in mind if you plan to stay here.</strong>
    </Callout>
    <p>When the hotel was somewhat resolved (or as resolved as it was going to be), I went to find something to eat and then arranged for my three rear bike bags to be picked up at the hotel the following morning and transported for me up the hill to the monastery at Roncesvalles.</p>

    <p>Saint Jean Pied-de-Port is all about the Camino. And crowded. A bit of a shock after the solitude of the previous weeks.</p>
    <p>I joined Leroy for a pleasant dinner, involving some local cider and a bottle of wine. A nice social time evening. Leroy was off the Pamplona the following day. A longish day, considering the climbing involved and a loaded bike. </p>

  	  <br /> Saint Jean Pied-de-Port, Nouvelle-Aquitane, France to Roncesvalles, Navarre, Spain
    </h5>
    (28.2km, 1033m, 1519.3 km to date)
    <p>Out of bed 'early' to leave my bags outside the reception before 8:00 am. Then a shower and a lie down until the reception opened at 9:00 am. Veronique had not heard anything back from head office about my reservation so I smiled, thanked her, and rode off to Lidl. I didnâ€™t have plans for breakfast so a â€˜plateâ€™ of sushi in one of Lidlâ€™s coolers seemed a good option. I breakfasted in the Lidl parking lot before heading off. Even without bags, the hills were troubling. And the floppy pedal didnâ€™t help, flopping forward a couple of inches on each revolution in addition to an inch or so laterally. Iâ€™m sure it wasnâ€™t a very efficient means of progress.</p>

    <p>There are two routes between Saint Jean Pied-de-Port and Roncesvalles/Roncevaux. The traditional hikers route goes high and then drops down to the pass at Ibaneta. More susceptible to poor weather conditions, this route is not recommended unless the weather is fine, and pilgrims are actually banned from this route for a few months over the winter. The other route, through Valcarlos, which has more vehicular traffic and a pretty steady climb up to the pass, is generally recommended for cyclists. This was the way for me to go!</p>

        I have since watched the film "The Way" about a man hiking the route for his son. His son had set off on the route from St Jean Pied-de-Port, taking the high route as is normal. An unseasonal storm descended and the son died. After visiting where his son was found, his father picked up his son's equipment in St Jean &ndash; and decided to make the pilgrimage for his son. Not a brilliant movie but it was nice to be able to recognise places along the 'way'.

    <p>Two loaded cyclists passed me and I didnâ€™t see them again. I plodded higher and higher, into the cloud. The weather forecast had specified thunder and lightning but I was fortunate: although damp mizzle (mist-cum-drizzle), there was no electrical activity and only a short period of light rain. I saw peregrinos for short sections of the road, where their path coincided with mine. But mainly the day was a dull plod, pedalling and pushing, up and further up, until I reached the top of the pass. A full day without anything to look at although Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s quite spectacular under the right conditions. A painful day, too, as each step was painful for my strained ankle; it is easier on the bike than walking beside it.</p>
    <p>Somewhere I passed out of France and into Spain. I didnâ€™t see any notification at all but my phone messaged me a welcome to Spain and I did start to see Guardia Civil vehicles on the road.</p>
    <p>I saw someone walking down towards me: an oldish Irish man wearing a dirty old raincoat and pushing (not literally at this point since the road was steeply downhill in his direction) an old pram (baby-stroller, to you North Americans) containing a couple of large plastic bags. If Iâ€™d seen him in Calgary, I would have assumed him homeless but here I wasnâ€™t so sure. Maybe just a little eccentric? He wasnâ€™t making much sense but he did seem to want to know how far it was to the next village.</p>

    <p>It was very socked in at the top but a short downhill brought me to the monastery in Roncesvalles. Where my bags awaited me :). A convivial dinner with a group of pilgrims and a night in the dorm were not too bad at all. In retrospect, I could (I think) have managed up the hill with my bags, albeit more slowly and painfully, but â€“ cheating or not â€“ I was quite happy with my decision.</p>

   <h5>
  	  May 24th, 2023
  	  <br /> Roncesvalles (Roncevaux) to Pamplona, Navarre
    </h5>
    (48.7km, 363 m, 1568.0 km to date)   
    <p>Lights on at 6:00 am sharp; a tough lot, those monks. I was Wordled, packed and breakfasted and ready to go before 8:00 am, by far the earliest start of any day I could recall.</p>
    <p>A downhill ride in a light drizzle to start. Poor visibility but clearing. Coming to the top of the first significant uphill section, I stopped to chat with a lady from the Netherlands. She had ridden down through France, as had I, but camping along the way. She was one of the two cyclists I had seen the previous day and had managed the ride with her laden bike. Those two artificial hips must work wonders! <span class="entity">ðŸ˜‰</span></p>
    <p>Although predominantly downhill, there was a second â€“ and harder â€“ uphill section to the top of Erro pass. I stopped at the pass for a couple of coffees from a drink truck parked there, and chatted with a couple of young English women who had bike-packed from Paris (with a little help from the train, apparently). They were heading to Santiago as well, before taking the train down to Porto â€˜to party.â€™</p>
    <p>The coffee wagon was well-equipped: alcohol (it is Spain!) as well as soft drinks and caffeine. Snacks, too. And a basket on the ground containing a selection of (mainly) women's panties. A sign said "Leave a pair, take a pair, find a soul mate." No hints about how to locate your soul mate from the underwear. One of the English lasses commented: "Too bad, but I'm not wearing any."</p>
    <p>There are definitely more travellers since arriving in Saint Jean Pied-de-Port, and a much different feel to the relatively empty French landscape.</p>

    <div class="caption">Stopped for coffee, rest and chatter at the top of Erro Pass</div>
    <p>I had expected to be arriving in Pamplona a day or two after Bevâ€™s arrival on the train from Barcelona but we were now arriving on the same day. It was exciting to think about meeting up after ten or more weeks apart. The apartment that we had booked for a few days was not expecting arrival until about 9:00 pm but I amended that to 4:00 pm and took it easy, with time to kill. With the sun out, if weakly, I had a leisurely lunch (old bread and Laughing Wow, nothing fancy) before proceeding, laboriously now as my errant pedal seemed to have even more play than before.</p>
    <p>Entrance to the city was fairly straightforward although cycle.travel didnâ€™t seem to acknowledge the address I was heading to. I switched over to Google Maps, no substitute for turn by turn instructions on my Wahoo handlebar computer. A steep, cobbled uphill was avoided by a conveniently placed elevator (ascensor) which seemed to be a favourite with cyclists.</p>

    <p>Navigation to the apartment continued to be a bit of a challenge using Google, involving a couple of circuits of the Plaza de Castillo until I found my bearings. But then I was at the apartment, let in, and shown around by the friendly Juan Manuel. Plenty of time for a shower before heading to the station to meet Bev.</p>
