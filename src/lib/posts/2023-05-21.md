  <h5>
  	May 6th, 2023
  	<br /> Civaux to Confolens, Nouvelle-Aquitaine
  </h5>
  (59.0 km, 590m, 840.7 km to date)

   <p> 
    A day’s rest, wonderful though it was, had no discernible effect on my tiredness. No new spring in my legs. No boundless energy. In fact, very little energy at all. I suspect it takes more than a single rest day, and probably more than two, to come back fresh and stronger. (When you’re of a certain age.)

    <p>So I set the bar low for this day. 50 kilometres to Confolens. Should be easy enough, I thought, as I eased slowly into the riding day. I had booked a room in Confolens before setting off, expecting a casual day. I should know better. It was hot. It was hilly, more elevation gain since in France and maybe since I left London. Lots of painstakingly slow up, lots of over-too-quickly freewheeling down again.
    </p>
    <p>Max pulled up beside when I was looking at a map on my phone. I was quite happy to stop and chat. Max is a builder from Marseilles, building the same way as we do in Canada. This style is picking up, from 3% to 12% over a time frame I don’t remember. He could only take three weeks away from his business so he was covering 150km/day. Mmm. Well, at his age, I had a couple of consecutive 160km days, on bumpy and pot-holed Indian roads and with a more heavily-laden bike than Max. But still impressive, I think. For some context, he is travelling very lightly: his loaded bike weighs one third the weight of mine. It was a nice chat, he seemed quite excited to see a 70-year-old doing what he was doing (if not how he was doing it!), and about our common professional backgrounds. I do enjoy these interactions with like-minded youngsters! (He’s 39!)

    <p>The countryside has changed: more green crops and pasture, more trees. Definitely more hills. There look to be more places to stealth camp if I get caught out, too. Although it would save money, I think it would have an impact on the following days productivity, largely because of not having good feeds. Bread and cheese is fine for lunch but not so good for three meals a day.

    <p>At one point, while checking the tariff at a campsite (extremely reasonable, &euro;5 without power, &euro;13 with) I saw a tandem roll by pulling what looked like a BOB trailer. Later, passing a different campsite, I noticed a solitary tourer who looked like he was setting up for the night. And then, when stopped half-way up a hill, a couple powered by with a “Howdy pardner.” Quite different from the wide emptiness of Normandie. More traffic, too.
    </p>
    <img alt="green fields, trees and hills" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-06-183436.jpg" />
    <p>It turned into my slowest day. I had messaged the place I was to stay in giving an estimated arrival time of around 6:00 pm. I messaged Davina again to amend that to 8:00 pm, hopefully arriving in time to get to Lidl or Aldi’s before they closed at 7:30. No such luck; the church bell was striking the half-hour as I arrived in town. It was Saturday of a long weekend so restocking might be a bit problematic…

    <p>The ‘Chambres d’Hotes’ was a magnificent old building with large rooms. The proprietress was English and very welcoming. I had a room up two flights of stairs which were a challenge after the days exertions but I felt pretty certain I’d sleep well. Dinner was at ‘The Chip Shop,’ maybe the first time I’ve had haddock and chips with half-a-litre of red! I sat outside and ate, and listened to the almost continual rolling thunder and frequent lightning flashes. The drops, when they came, were large but short-lived.
