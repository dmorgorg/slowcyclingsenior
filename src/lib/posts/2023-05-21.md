  	May 6th, 2023
  	<br /> Civaux to Confolens, Nouvelle-Aquitaine
  </h5>
  (59.0 km, 590m, 840.7 km to date)

   <p> 
    A day’s rest, wonderful though it was, had no discernible effect on my tiredness. No new spring in my legs. No boundless energy. In fact, very little energy at all. I suspect it takes more than a single rest day, and probably more than two, to come back fresh and stronger. (When you’re of a certain age.)
   </p>
    <img alt="Ubiquitous poppies" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-06-111416.jpg" />
    <p>So I set the bar low for this day. 50 kilometres to Confolens. Should be easy enough, I thought, as I eased slowly into the riding day. I had booked a room in Confolens before setting off, expecting a casual day. I should know better. It was hot. It was hilly, more elevation gain since in France and maybe since I left London. Lots of painstakingly slow up, lots of over-too-quickly freewheeling down again.
    </p>
    <p>Max pulled up beside when I was looking at a map on my phone. I was quite happy to stop and chat. Max is a builder from Marseilles, building the same way as we do in Canada. This style is picking up, from 3% to 12% over a time frame I don’t remember. He could only take three weeks away from his business so he was covering 150km/day. Mmm. Well, at his age, I had a couple of consecutive 160km days, on bumpy and pot-holed Indian roads and with a more heavily-laden bike than Max. But still impressive, I think. For some context, he is travelling very lightly: his loaded bike weighs one third the weight of mine. It was a nice chat, he seemed quite excited to see a 70-year-old doing what he was doing (if not how he was doing it!), and about our common professional backgrounds. I do enjoy these interactions with like-minded youngsters! (He’s 39!)
    </p>
    <p>The countryside has changed: more green crops and pasture, more trees. Definitely more hills. There look to be more places to stealth camp if I get caught out, too. Although it would save money, I think it would have an impact on the following days productivity, largely because of not having good feeds. Bread and cheese is fine for lunch but not so good for three meals a day.
    </p>
    <img alt="green fields, trees and hills" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-06-173049.jpg" />
    <p>At one point, while checking the tariff at a campsite (extremely reasonable, &euro;5 without power, &euro;13 with) I saw a tandem roll by pulling what looked like a BOB trailer. Later, passing a different campsite, I noticed a solitary tourer who looked like he was setting up for the night. And then, when stopped half-way up a hill, a couple powered by with a “Howdy pardner.” Quite different from the wide emptiness of Normandie. More traffic, too.
    </p>
    <img alt="green treed lanes" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-06-183436.jpg" />
    <p>It turned into my slowest day. I had messaged the place I was to stay in giving an estimated arrival time of around 6:00 pm. I messaged Davina again to amend that to 8:00 pm, hopefully arriving in time to get to Lidl or Aldi’s before they closed at 7:30. No such luck; the church bell was striking the half-hour as I arrived in town. It was Saturday of a long weekend so restocking might be a bit problematic…
    </p>

    <div class="caption">Arrival in Confolens, a little after seven.</div>
    <p>The ‘Chambres d’Hotes’ was a magnificent old building with large rooms. The proprietress was English and very welcoming. I had a room up two flights of stairs which were a challenge after the days exertions but I felt pretty certain I’d sleep well. Dinner was at ‘The Chip Shop,’ maybe the first time I’ve had haddock and chips with half-a-litre of red! I sat outside and ate, and listened to the almost continual rolling thunder and frequent lightning flashes. The drops, when they came, were large but short-lived.

  	May 7th, 2023
  	<br /> Confolens to Massignac, Nouvelle-Aquitaine
  </h5>
  (33.7 km, 528m, 874.4 km to date)

  <p>(The above data is taken from RideWithGPS since my Garmin inReach stopped recording two-thirds through the day.)
  </p>
  <p>Davina very kindly packed me a bit of a lunch, and pointed me in the direction of shop where I could buy some cheese and a boulangerie where I could get bread. So I wasn’t going to starve.
  </p>
  <img alt="bridge over La Vienne" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-07-120701.jpg" />
  <div class="caption">First of the day’s La Vienne crossing</div>
  <p>I set off slowly, conserving energy, pedalling up the hills. But it was slow going. I stopped to chat with the cyclist I’d seen at the campsite the previous day (another Brit) and then the couple on the tandem came by. Ah, the tandem is pedal-assist! The 74-year old in front was from England but had lived in Nelson, BC, for many years (about three decades) before moving to the Netherlands. His ‘stoker’ is Dutch.
  </p>
  <p>We all set off, the guy I’d stopped to talk to first was going to head off in another direction, to a campsite where he was meeting a friend. I puffed up a long hill, then another, and dropped down into the Vienne valley and crossed the river for the third time this day. And there was the gent looking at his map, wondering where to go next. His route had not included the hills that mine had! But now he did leave, from Exideuil, in a different direction, never to be seen again.
  </p>
    <img alt="cows in a field" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-07-124821.jpg" />
    <p>It was now getting late in the day. I thought I could make it past Massignac which only appeared to have a 500 Euro a night spa by way of accommodation. It might be a stealth night for me after all; there did seem to be a number of grassy fields, shielded by trees and bushes, where I could hide out.
    </p>
    <p>Just before Massignac I saw a sign for “Gites de Cruzeau” and went to investigate: who knows, there might be rooms available. There weren’t, all having been rented to a single party. But very nice guests tried to get me sorted, eventually suggested the town where my solitary Brit tourist had been heading. Not my direction, unfortunately. But then they found a hotel, Auberge des Lacs, in Massignac. With one room, if I got there quickly.
    </p>
   <p> The French peopele that I have interacted with have all be friendly, and not at all offended by my rudimentary French language attempts.</p>

  	  May 8th, 2023<br />Massignac to Angoulême, Nouvelle-Aquitaine
    </h5>
    (67.0 km, 679 m, 941.4 km to date)
    <p>A pleasant breakfast at the Auberge des Lacs and then back at it. Tuesday promised to be very wet with significant amounts of rain so I could try harder today and rest on the next day. Based on nothing but baseless optimism, I aimed for Angoulême: twice the distance of the previous day and more elevation gain. I hedged my bets, though, and didn’t yet book any accommodation.</p>

    <p>The first climb was less than 40m and was a challenge. According to my cycle computer, there were eleven noted climbs in the day, with an average elevation gain of around 60m. This first climb didn’t augur well. But I just plodded on, hill after hill, including a brutal one of 110m. Somehow, I cycled them.

    <div class="caption">A much appreciated gentle rail trail</div>
    <p>I had an earlier lunch, bread and cheese by a cemetery, and carried on to some welcome rail trail path. A very green day, grass and abundant trees. And a very pretty day. The final climb into Angoulême felt never ending. Student types, pulling suitcases behind them, passed me as I pedaled slowly and painfully forever up. By my reckoning, I had earned a rest day.

    <p>I walked into the centre in search of food. And found some interesting murals. There are many more than I’ve shown here but this was meant to be a rest day, not a day pounding the pavement (although it did turn into a bit of such a day). There is a history of comic production in Angoulême and this is represented in some of the murals.</p>

    <p>Not so much to say about today. Another lovely day. Rather than press on, I found a Chambre d’Hote about 5 km off route but I could head south in the morning to regain the route, taking the other two sides of the square. And it was a lovely place to spend a night. Saint Jean-de-Blaignac, on the Dordogne river.
