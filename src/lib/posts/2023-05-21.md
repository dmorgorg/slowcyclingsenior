    <p>I chatted with Jordan, the Vietnamese host, for a while. He, and his mother, worked in a Vietnamese restaurant in Saint Emilion. His mother had been in France for ten years, sending money home, before he could join her. He left for work and I enjoyed the solitude of this marvelous house before, somewhat reluctantly, getting on my way sometime after 1.00 pm!</p>
    <p>Gently hilly quiet roads for a few kilometres and then a rail trail. With repurposed, or at least re-owned, railwayman‚Äôs cottages along the way.</p>

    <p>More evidence that I really was in wine country; I'm not that far from Bordeaux. The route detours to Bordeaux and back again but, being a little short of time and needing to be in Pamplona to meet my wife, I will cut that corner and save some time.</p>

    <p>Pleasant countryside to be riding through.</p>
    <p>By the time I reached La R√©ole, the sun was getting low. There didn't seem to be much available for accommodation so I chose the municipal campsite over the available dormitory and rode on to the other side of time and over La Gironne.</p>
    <p>I set up camp and headed back over the river for dinner: a sardine dish with interesting, presumably local, vegetables. Hip place, I fit right in. <span class="entity">üòâ</span></p>
    <p>I camped next to a French couple walking from Normandie to Compostela de Santiago with a couple of wheelbarrows. Modified but still standard small-wheel wheelbarrows. Handles extended with PVC plumbing pipe, suspended from hip belts. And they were wearing backpacks, too. They started in late March and expect to reach Santiago de Compostela in late August. Good luck, Melonie and Eric. The more I looked at these home-made conveyances, the more the Packwheel (based around a 27.5‚Ä≥ mountain-bike wheel, with the weight balanced over the wheel ‚Äì and with a brake!) looked like a good option.</p>

   <h5>
  	  May 14th, 2023
  	  <br /> La R√©ole to Damazan, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (50.3 km, 390 m, 1185.1 km to date)
    <p>I retraced my steps into La R√©ole and up a steep hill to find the boulangerie. Sunday morning! Then stopped at a caf√© for a coffee. It was noon and many of the clientele were settled into their first quantity of wine for the day. I stayed with my caf√© cr√®me although it would have been very pleasant to adopt some of the local culture and spend a lazy afternoon sipping wine and reading a book. My coffee was pretty good but not really a substitute.</p>
    <p>After a short while riding, I was on a path alongside the Canal de Garonne. The ‚ÄúLe Canal des Deux-Mers‚Äù refers to this canal, and the next: le Canal du Midi which link the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. Little if any traffic on the canal, a handful at most of pleasure craft all day. And I followed the canal all day.</p>
    <p>I was pausing to take a photograph when I heard a couple behind me talking in English, an older lady and (I presume) her daughter, also on bikes. We chatted; they are from New Zealand and are cycling the canal trail. I didn‚Äôt get full details of their trip but did learn (I asked!) that the mother is eighty-six! Full of sparkle. They had rented e-bikes for the journey.</p>

    <div class="caption">Eighty-six year old mother in the lead (in blue)!</div>
    <p>It was very pretty, very green and very calming. I sat by a lock to have brunch (I had only had a handful of bread torn off the loaf I‚Äôd bought in the morning and had been looking for somewhere to sit and eat).</p>

    <p>A warmer day, with sunshine. Easy riding but I feel a rest day (physical and mental) coming on. I don‚Äôt have much spare time, if any, to get to Pamplona by the time that Bev arrives but I also sense that I am grinding to a halt. Hopefully a rest day can fix that. There looks to be a reasonable hotel in Damazan‚Ä¶</p>

   <h5>
  	  May 16th, 2023
  	  <br /> Damazan to Cazaubon, Nouvelle-Aquitane
    </h5>
    (76.6 km, 655 m, 1261.7 km to date)
    <p>Things are starting to blur: writing this on the 19th, I can recall no details of the rest day in Damozan. Or of Damozan itself. I need to take more pictures as memory-joggers. But the rest day can‚Äôt have done me any harm; this is probably my best day yet in terms of progress.</p>
    <p>It started with a further quiet 9 kilometres along the canal before breaking off southwards across country. Wooded countryside and more hills than seems absolutely necessary ‚Äì the very flat north of France has spoiled me. My knees seem to be standing up to the hills, apart from the odd painful twinge. We‚Äôll see whether the Pyrenees make the case for a new pair of knees.</p>
    <img alt="one of many historical buildings" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-16-123425.jpg" />
    <p>Then about 20 km of double track, presumably an old railway line that has not been ‚Äòupgraded‚Äô to tarmac. More pleasant, by far, despite making progress a little harder. I was held up a little initially by a large group of seniors out on a guided nature ramble of some sort who encouraged me in that most French of ways: ‚ÄúAllez, allez!‚Äù It was fun and brought a smile to my face.</p>
    <img alt="off road riding." src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-16-132045.jpg" />
    <p>For the most part, the trail was dry. My almost-slick tyres are not so good in the mud so I wheeled around some stretches that offered the opportunity for a mud-splattering face-plant.</p>
