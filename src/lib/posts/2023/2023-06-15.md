    <br /> La Virgen del Camino to Astorga, Castilla y Le&oacute;n
    <br />(41.6km, 279m, 2069.8 km to date)   
  </h5>
  <p>Either beside the N120 or on the N120 for most of the day. Sometimes the road was a considerate option since there were quite a number of pilgrims walking the senda alongside the highway. I do still feel that the Camino belongs to the walkers and we bikers should do as little as possible to interfere with their pilgrimage.</p>

    <br /> Astorga to Santa Colomba de Somoza, Castilla y Le&oacute;n
    <br />(20.4 km, 302 m, 2090.2 km to date)   
  </h5>
  <p>A quiet night in Santa Colomba de Somoza in a pleasant room. The door to the building was controlled by clicking a button in a browser on the phone; it didn’t work immediately so we weren’t entirely sure we had the right place. But we were finally admitted. Pretty clever technology, I thought. </p>
  <p>Our room was on the third floor. The elevator was small, too small to accommodate even a vertical bike, so we were resigned to leaving our bikes in the foyer of the building. Two other guests, in cycling apparel, returned from dinner as we were considering options; they informed us that the manager would take care of our bikes. We messaged him and, yes, he took care of them (and returned them in time for our departure the following morning).</p>

  <p>On the way out of town, we went past the Gaudi museum, housed in one of the few buildings he designed outside Barcelona. (We visited another example when riding the Camino del Norte.) </p>
  <p>The building had something of a Disney feel to it along with not-so-subtle camino-shell inspired arches at the main entrance.</p>

  <p>Our plan had been to go over a high pass but the weather was coming in and we decided on discretion.</p> 
  <img alt="Storm clouds gathering" src="/images/2023/06/phone/20230612_1846.jpg" />
  <div class="caption">Dark sky threatening.</div>
  <p>A room was available in a lovely village; another garret but the rain, mixed with hail, pounding on the skylights made our decision seem sensible. And when we walked (or hobbled, in my case) up the steep main street to the church to listen to some Gregorian chanting performed by a couple of priest, we were glad to have been ‘forced’ to cut short our day.</p>

    <br /> Santa Colomba de Somoza to Cacabelos, Castilla y Le&oacute;n
    <br />(50.6 km, 631 m, 2161.2 km to date)   
  </h5>
  <p>Pleasant countryside but fiercely uphill. It would have been tough the day before, in the rain. Foolish, even.</p>
  <p>I checked my rear wheel (which wasn’t spinning as freely as it should) and made some adjustments so that it was only gravity I was fighting against. Progress was hard enough without riding uphill with my brake on.</p>
  
  <p>While my bike was upside down at the side of the road, an old Frenchman (mid-eighties, I’d guess) with a long bushy white beard walked past, pushing his old bike. It was probably a top-of-the-line model, fifty or more years ago. Single speed, with a small rear sprocket. Tough old feller.</p>

  <p>At the first summit was a high cross with a large pile of stones that pilgrims had deposited over the years. A nice little chapel. And a picnic spot where we had lunch. </p>

  <p>A little more uphill to the high point that I didn’t notice in passing, then some wonderful downhill. Lots of downhill.</p>

  <p>The stage ended at Ponferrada but we carried on, on the mountain-bike cum pilgrims’ route through nice vineyards on gravel roads to Cocabelos.</p>

  <p>A nice church on the way out of Cacabelos with some beautiful stained glass work, where we self-administered a sello..</p>

  <Callout>
  <strong>Update: 26th December, 2023</strong> I don't think I've mentioned <strong>sello</strong> before. To be bonafide pilgrims and eligible to stay in albergues (cheap pilgrim hostels, with dormitories and, occasionally, private rooms), you need a 'passport' or 'credential' booklet that you get stamped at cathedrals, albergues, even shops along the way. The stamp is called a sello.

  <p>A sharp ping from the rear wheel was not the tyre firing a rock sideways as I’d hoped but, as I'd suspected, a broken spoke. Fortunately, we were only a few minutes from Villafranca de Bierzos, home to a good bike shop. Google said it was temporarily closed but Google has been known to make mistakes before.</p>
  <p>I stayed with the bikes while Bev ventured down the steep hill in search of the bike shop (she was protecting my gammy ankle) and found it closed; a neighbour said that he had got in his car and driven away. For lunch? For a few weeks? More like the latter, it seemed.</p>
  <p>Google was correct this time but ‘temporarily closed’ could have been a little more specific. The next bike shop is over the hill!</p>
  <img alt="Castilla y Leon" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-14-143901.jpg" />
  <p>In the mid-afternoon, as we were leaving a village, about seven km (and 500m vertical, for an average grade of 7%) from the next accommodation that we knew of, we decided that tomorrow was another day. And stayed put.</p>

    <br />  Vega de Valcarce, Castilla y León, to Samos, Galicia
    <br /> (48.6 km, 991 m, 2310.6 km to date)   
  </h5>
  <p>A reasonable start (before ten) but behind the pack. Nothing new there. Uphill, rideable to start, through lovely, brilliant green, countryside. What a spectacular area! Then it was time to push.</p>
  <p>This road is a very popular training climb for roadies (road bikers). On their light carbon unloaded bikes!</p>
  <img alt="Steep road" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-124304.jpg" />
  <p>Some riders passed us, some roadies walked/clacked past in their clip-in shoes. Some more reasonably loaded (younger and fitter, too) peregrinos or cycle tourists cycled past. An amputee on/in a hand-cycle, connected to an assisting mountain bike rider by a tow-rope rolled past. I think the lead rider was e-powered. </p>
  <p>Once on the steep stuff, Bev was away in front. My right knee (which has overtaken my left ankle in terms of pain inflicted) wasn’t too bad on the bike so I rode as much as I could before having to get off and push. Even pushing the bike, Bev is faster than me. Or maybe more determined; I’m too willing to stop and rest, enjoy the view (even when there isn’t one).</p>
  <p>We met Samson by the side of the road; he’d decided it was too hard and was calling for a taxi. By his accent, I guessed Indian subcontinent. He had been doing the Camino every year for a while and was finally coming round to the idea of getting an e-bike. (We saw him later and, having been unsuccessful in his attempt to get a taxi, had carried on under his own steam.)</p> 
 
  <img alt="Steep road" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-124344.jpg" />
  <p>We stopped for refreshments (and for me to lose my streak on Wordle) in La Lagola? as a dozen or more cows were herded past, then continued. Managing to ride now. Stupendous views of a green treed hilly landscape. Magical countryside. Then the top,</p>
  <p>Some thatched building at the top. And lots of caf&eacute;s catering to weary travellers.</p> 
  <img alt="The summit" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-135558.jpg" />
  <img alt="The summit" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-135615.jpg" />
  <p>And, after a quick church visit, down the other side. There were still a couple of wearing climbs, one to an impressive pilgrim sculpture and then Alto de Polo.</p>
  <img alt="The other side, down!" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-141459.jpg" />
  <img alt="The other side, down!" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-141522.jpg" />
  <img alt="The other side, down!" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-144653.jpg" />
  <p>Alto de Polo passed unnoticed; there was no sign and we couldn't tell where the actual summit was. Bev had been hoping for a selfie of the two of us. (Aren't selfies a kiddies thing? We have 135 years between us!)</p>
    <img alt="The other side, down!" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-144706.jpg" />
  <img alt="The other side, down!" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-15-165142.jpg" />
  <p>Down to Samos for the night where we lucked out with accommodation. Bev had paid for a room with private bathroom in an albergue but something had been lost in translation and the bathroom was shared. Sufficient reason to claim this was unsuitable, and get a refund, before adjourning to a lovely hotel I had found online while Bev had been arranging the albergue accommodation.</p>
  <p>A lovely hotel it was, with excellent food to boot. The only downside was the room was too warm for us to get a perfect rest overnight.</p>
