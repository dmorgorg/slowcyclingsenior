    May 30th, 2023
    <br /> Pamplona to Puente la Reina, Navarre
    (34.6km, 504m, 1602.6 km to date)
  </h5>
  <p>One thousand miles since Greenwich!</p>
  <Callout>I’ve already been on the real Camino, from Saint Jean Pied-de-Port. But, for me, the Camino that I had long looked forward to starts here, with Bev beside me. Our cycling trips together have been magical and I have no doubt that this will be as good as any of the others.</Callout>

  <div class="caption">We're on our way, leaving Pamplona behind.</div>
  <p>A few last minute adjustments, mainly to bikes and we were off around 11:30 am. A gentle ride out of town with only a few mis-steps, thanks in large part to excellent signage for both walking and cycling peregrinos.</p>
  <img alt="Outside Pamplona" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-30-130243.jpg" />
  <p>Then lots of ups and downs, mainly ups, through beautiful countryside. Green fields and poppies in abundance.</p>

  <p>A significant amount of gravel road and tracks: very pleasant but more tiring. One steep section on rocky terrain encouraged us both to get off and push although this didn’t prove to be that much easier. The rough ground was particularly taxing on my gammy ankle.</p>
  <img alt="Outside Pamplona" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-30-150941.jpg" />
  <p>We were high enough at one point to go through pine forest, and there was evidence not far away of recent forest fires (which I assume had not been controlled burns). Another delightful section took us down a path between and beneath an extended arch of tree-cover that would provide welcome shade on a hot day to foot-weary pilgrims.</p>

  <p>Speaking of which: it was quite a hot day, sunny with ominously dark clouds threatening and rumbling but never actually following through on their threats.</p>

  <p>Hotel Rural Bidean provided comfortable lodgings and food for us. The food seemed a bit pricy by peregrino standards so we may need to look further afield in future. That said, it’s hard to wander off, hungry, in search of a better deal after a tiring day of travel when there is food available in front of you.</p>
  <p>After dinner, we went for a relaxed stroll, down to the Puente (bridge) which looked very elegant in the evening light. It’s probably looked very elegant for a few hundred years now.</p>

    <br /> Puente la Reina to Estella-Lizarra, Navarre
    (23.7km, 406m, 1626.3 km to date)
  </h5>
  <img alt="Outside the hotel in Puente la Reina" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-31-101413.jpg" />
  <p>After checking out of Hotel Rural Bidean, we just rolled as far as the old bridge a couple of hundred metres away, for some photographs and to set up Bev’s cycle-computer a little better. We hadn’t been able to log in to the wifi at the hotel so out in the open and using data on the phone was better.</p>
  <img alt="Puente la Reina" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-31-102835.jpg" />
  <div class="caption">Puente la Reina. (Puente means bridge)</div>
  <p>In the morning I’d found links to gpx files relating to the guide book to cycling the Camino Frances. This promises to be a better solution than the files I’d been trying. Now it was an opportunity to get them onto Bev’s old phone, the mobile equivalent of a rotary dialler.</p>
  <img alt="Puente la Reina" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-31-104145.jpg" />
  <p>Our guide had descriptions for mountain bike routing and for a gentler road alternative. Today we started on the mountain bike route: beautiful pastoral countryside on a flat gravel road. </p>
  <img alt="Puente la Reina" src="/images/2023/05/1600/2023-05-31-105559.jpg" />
  <p>We started to climb in pine forest and we had to get off and push but it was still a pleasure. Not for long, though, as the trail reared up dramatically, and had deep channels from rain runoff that made pushing even harder. It was a real grunt to the top of a pass, where we sheltered in the shade for awhile, considering our options. Road or mountain bike? The road route had more gentle climbs and rideable on a smooth tarmac surface. For the rest of this day, we settled for road. Not as pleasant or as scenic, by any means, but facilitating better progress.</p>

  <div class="caption">A Roman bridge, and a peregrino.</div>
  <p>We were passed by a couple of Canadian maritimers (one on an e-bike) who had set off from Pamplona this morning. Ah, the energy of youth! At the top of a hill, I chatted to a 72 year old man from the Netherlands who was waiting for his ‘big’ sister to catch up. Which she did shortly. Big sister was 84. Another lady was with them: all had ridden down from the Netherlands, taking about four weeks, and camping most nights. E-bikes made it easier but still an inspiration.</p>

  <div class="caption">They make wine in Spain too.</div>
  <p>With about eight kilometres to Estella, we stopped for lunch. By a sign to the motorway (than we had been paralleling on the quiet N1110) that said Pamplona was 34 kilometres away. Not such an impressive distance for the better part of two days for us! We had managed to find some extra mileage the day before but we were still maintaining a very sedate pace.</p>

  <div class="caption">A late lunch stop: bread and cheese, of course.</div>
  <p>Estella appears to have none of the magic of Puente la Reina, more of a town than an old historic village. Our hotel is underwhelming, too. But you have to have to downs to fully appreciate the ups. So I am told.</p>

  <p>Dinner was delayed by a dramatic thunderstorm but did the job. The Hotel El Volante was far from anything special, staffed by a grumpy old man and his more accommodating wife. It seemed like they had converted a couple of flats into a ‘hotel.’ The common area appeared to be their living room.</p>

    <br /> Estella-Lizarro to Sansol, Navarre
    (25.1km, 330m, 1651.4 km to date)
  </h5>
  <p>We decided to stick to the road route today. More pedalling, less brutal pushing up steep rain-channeled trails. Not so pretty but not so wearing.</p>
  <p>No octogenarians today but a few two-wheeled peregringos. Sensibly-aged and much quicker than us. Despite the climbing, the landscape is turning more towards rural plain than all hills. Why doesn't it feel easier then? </p>

  <p>Bev wants short days to ease into things so we considered stopping in Los Arcos, less than 20km for the day. It didn't look very exciting so we carried on to Sansol and got a double room in a private albergue before four o'clock. A small, old village &ndash; very different from Estella. And much nicer. A communal dinner so more social, with some (multi-cultural) spirit of the camino. We should/will do more of this. Not just because it is less expensive. </p>

  <p>Lots of time before and after dinner but not much energy for blogging...or anything.</p>
