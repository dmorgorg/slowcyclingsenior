	<h5>
		April 17th, 2023 <br />
		Greenwich to Farthing Down, London Borough of Croydon
	</h5>
	(27.9 km, 288 m ascent, 27.9 km to date)
	<p>	
	I weighed my loaded bike: 116 lb/53 kg.
	</p>
	<p>
	Including some food and three litres of water, but still very heavy. The last time I weighed it, prior to a short tour at home in Alberta, it was at 90 lb/41 kg, which I then considered very heavy. What’s different this time?
	</p>
	<p>
	Well, I do have a bivvy bag in addition to a tent, which I hadn’t before. Belts and braces? Perhaps. But the bivvy is great for stealth camping, hiding almost in plain sight. The tent is better for a regular campground, and required for when Bev joins me. So there’s a couple of pounds there.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have my bike bag (a Ground Effects Tardis), used for putting my bike into for flights since I don’t know where I will get to or how I will return. That’s four more pounds.
	</p>
	<p>	
	Three guidebooks: Avenue Verte, Camino de Santiago, and Ruta de la Plata. All of which I could use. An Ortlieb Rackpack, that sits across my rear panniers, and probably is four pounds. A heavier Tubus rack.
	</p>
	<p>
	But how does this all add up to 26 lb? A quick repack didn’t pare much, just six pounds less, and I no longer have my guidebooks. Maybe I’ll get Bev to bring the two Spanish ones when she joins me.

	<p>
	Mum came out to the edge of her garden to “see me off” as best she could with her failed eyesight. My brother Chris and son Nicolas were also in attendance as I wobbled off down the road. Not such a bad wobble, really, considering the load. High noon start. As usual.

	</div>
	<p>
	Finally off! I followed National Cycle Network 21 (NCN21) south from Greenwich rather than the more usual Avenue Verte start from the London Eye; there didn’t seem much point in heading off in the wrong direction especially as I was not very excited about riding through London at all. 
	</p>
	<p>
	(Chris had offered me a ride to get out of the worst of London, or even down to Newhaven for the ferry, but I have started a couple of tours from Mum’s flat before and didn’t want to break with that tradition.)

	<p>
	Despite the built-up nature of the surroundings, it wasn’t unpleasant. The sun was shining and, after an impressive five or so kilometres, I stopped for 20 minutes in a park, in Catford, to enjoy the greenery and let the fact that I was on the road again sink in. I continued, slowly (of course), and quickly realised that Groombridge, where I knew of a campground, was not a feasible destination for the first night.

	<p>
	I had a long climb up to the top of Farthing Down, a beautiful and quite untouched area still, technically, in London; the light had a late afternoon quality to it. Five pm. This might be a good place to check out my new bivvy bag!

	<p>
	I found a large, grassy area sheltered and hidden from the road by a circle of trees. A couple of dog-walkers walked by, and a couple for an evening stroll, but no-one seemed too concerned by my presence. A couple of police officers roused me in the night but didn’t seem determined to move me on. It didn’t make much sense, but dreams are like that.

		Farthing Down to Forest Row, East Sussex

    I don’t remember much about this day (coming back to this entry after a week or so) but I do remember having a quick look in this church soon after I started.

    And, much later, I do recall reaching East Grinstead not long before dark. There was nothing to be found in terms of accommodation. The helpful lady at the Travelodge found a room in Forest Row and I phoned them; yes, they had a room, but by their own admission it was not a particularly attractive room. Fortunately, the route to Forest Row was traffic-free, along a rail trail, so the diminishing daylight was not too much of an issue. The woman who apologetically showed me the room dropped the price for me without any prompting – after all, I was out of options so I was going to take it anyway. Shared bathroom down the hall but I brought in the special bottle I keep on my down tube expressly for this purpose (or for nights in a tent).

		April 19th, 2023 <br /> Forest Row to Hailsham, East Sussex
	</h5> (49.1 km, 658 m ascent, 127.2 km to date)
	<p>
	The day got off to a cracking start. Stumbling down the hallway to the bathroom, I was too focused on the high step in the floor to notice the low headroom beam. Crack! Fifteenth-century buildings have some disadvantages, occasional beams at chin-height being one of them. My bell had been well and truly rung before I had been out of bed for more than a few minutes. I’ll be wearing a goose-egg for a couple of days.
	</p>
	<p>
	I had my usual noon start and shortly found myself on a pleasantly flat rail-trail down an avenue of trees. Some cloud, some sun, lots of birdsong. Very quiet, apart from the birds.
	</p>
	<img alt="rail trail" src="/images/2023/04/1600/2023-04-19-131803.jpg" />
	<div class="caption">Pleasant, gentle rail-trail riding</div>
	<p>
	In my mid-teens, and then again for a spell in my early-twenties, I was a regular visitor to the village, it being home to Harrison’s Rocks, a low sandstone edge with an abundance of strenuous rock-climbing. Back when I was young, slim and strong. And fitter, too: I remember cycling down to “Harrison’s” one day, climbing, then cycling home. It had now taken me more than two (admittedly short) days to make the journey one way. I could blame the heavy bike but I know it would be more honest to blame my own extra sixtyy pounds – and fifty years – and a sad lack of fitness. Never mind, I can’t fix the age but, conceivably, this ride will do something for the poundage and the fitness.
	</p>
	<p>
	At the end of the rail-trail there was as sign pointing left, advertising “Groombridge 1/4” Tempting, but not today; I still had a long way to go and I was definitely struggling with the effects of the last two days exertions. Now the terrain became up and down, up and down, somewhat euphemistically referred to as “rolling.” Rolling is a hard way to make progress with the climbs taking more time – and effort – than is regained on the ensuing descents.
	</p>
	<p>
	According to my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt cycle-computer, there was more down than up. Much more; at one point the Bolt me that I was a couple of hundred metres below sea-level. The reason for this strange reading: my uphill progress is really slow, whether pedalling along at 4 kph or off the bike and pushing, and the Wahoo doesn’t seem to record these embarrassing speeds (or at least I haven’t figured how to make it record at these speeds – turning off auto-pause doesn’t help). As a result, distance doesn’t count, nor metres climbed, when travelling painfully (and I do mean that) slowly uphill. On the other hand, downhill sections are recorded. At the end of the day, Wahoo recorded 42 km of progress and my Garmin (which remains operable at walking pace) recorded 49.1 km. Reading between the lines, it does appear that seven kilometres was slow pedalling or trudging uphill.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some of the route was along bridlepaths, not far from busy roads, and I was unable to ride much of them. There were long sections of quiet, narrow lanes (with little traffic, and that there was was considerate) but forever up and down, up to high ground and forest. One section headed off across a muddy field before a long uphill struggle on rough ground. It was tough sledding for me, and I spent much time, stopped, and gathering mental and physical resources for the next few yards. It was beginning to look that I would be late, after dark, arriving in Hailsham where I had a room booked. There were possibilities aplenty for stealth camping but the room was paid for and not refundable so on I pressed.

	<div class="caption">Plenty of places to bed down for the night.</div>	
	<p>
	Then I seemed to have reached a high point (as far as elevation is concerned, mentally and physically were very different matters) and I followed a quiet road to another rail-trail. Rail-trails are generally level but this one wasn’t – it led slightly but steadily and easily downhill and into Hailsham. There had been much silent complaining but I’d made it. Without that friendly last several miles, I might have still been on the road at nine. Instead of enjoying lamb chilli masala in the Rajdoot.

		I need a rest day. Or two. I’ll stay a second night (or, who knows, if it’s as wet as forecast on Friday, maybe a third night!)

		April 21st, 2023 <br /> Hailsham to Newhaven, East Sussex
	</h5> (37.1 km, 215 m ascent, 164.3 km to date)
	<p>		
		After a much appreciated rest day, and a second curry at the Rajdoot, I had a lovely, casual day through some of the best of English countryside. I had booked the overnight ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe and had all day, so was in no rush and felt justified in crawling along and stopping frequently.		
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, I did have some backtracking. A muddy bridlepath didn’t have much appeal to me so I referred to some info on the website (cycle.travel) where I’d found the gpx file for the Avenue Verte. The site mentioned that riders on bikes with narrow tyres had an alternative route, including a newly paved cycle path. So, back to the road and through Polegate. Where I was distracted by a Costa Coffee shop.

	<p>
	It was pleasant to sit enjoying a coffee, watching the grey skies turn blue, with not much more than a couple of hours to the ferry terminal.

	<p>
	A magical day, marred only slightly by Newhaven. Despite dawdling in Seaford, enjoying the somewhat weak sunshine and the lovely deserted beach, I still had to kill time waiting to be able to board the ferry. Two hours perched on an uncomfortable bench outside McDonalds while a steady flow of Uber-eats delivery riders on scooters passed in and out. It didn't look the easiest, or most satisfying, way to make a living. Wonderful thing, this gig economy. For the bosses. A very different feel than the timeless splendour of most of the day.
