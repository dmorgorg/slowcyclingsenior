  <h5>
    Jun 16th, 2023
    <br /> Samos to Barbadelos, Galicia
   </h5>(16.5km, 314m, 2327.1 km to date)   
  
  <p>A nice breakfast at Hotel A Veiga after a broken night: it was very hot in the room in an otherwise perfect hotel. We set off before ten and got in to Sarria about an hour and a half later. Dos Ruedas, the bike shop, was easy to find; we rang the bell and, when the proprietor opened the door, showed him the issue. No problem. I took off the bags, and the offending wheel, with which he disappeared while we took liquid refreshment in the café next door.</p>

  <div class="caption">In for repairs at the bike shop situated right on the Camino &ndash; notice the shell!</div>
  <p>A short while later, the proprietor reappeared and showed me some sealant; my tyre was dry (but not leaking air!). I used the sealant that I had been carrying for over 2000km. Not long after 12:30, we were back on the road. Or, more accurately, on an alley along the Camino. Just over one hundred km from Santiago.</p>
  <p>Sarria is a popular destination for those wishing to walk the minimum 100km distance to Santiago and still qualify for a certificate. There was much evidence of this, a more commercial aspect, with albergues, restaurants and more pilgrims than we had seen so far. We decided on lunch to power us through our overly-ambitious plans for the afternoon. The menu del dia was disappointing, a standard menu but small portions. Evidence of what was to follow for the next kilometres into Santiago, I suspected.</p>
  <p>It was the hottest day so far and the steep slippery gravel Camino track, no doubt a difficult push at the best of times, did me in. I had no energy at all. Plans, objectives changed and we tried to get a room at pretty much the first albergue we saw after Sarria, in Barbadelos. No luck so we were back in steep open country but found refuge at O Pambol, a few hundreds metres further on. It was only 200 fairly flat metres off the Camino itself but it is a measure of our (mainly mine) tiredness that Bev phoned to check on a room rather than us riding there ‘on spec’.</p>
  <p>Yes, they had a private room. Into which we (mainly me) collapsed. It was nice to have an early halt to the day, in an albergue.</p>
  <p>After showering and recovering somewhat, we sat out in the rural garden. Chickens wandered about. The views were of rolling hills, tree-bordered fields and more distant hills. A pleasantly social evening meal with four other pilgrims (a Swiss man and his mother, a French man of about my age and an Australian woman with a healthy thirst) was the perfect ending to a very short day. Our garret was warm so I slept naked with no covers, comfortably.</p>

    <br /> Barbadelos to Palas de Rei, Galicia
   </h5>(43.0 km, 831 m, 2370.1 km to date)   
  <p>Out the door and riding at 8:00. Still the last to leave of all the pilgrim guests but a record for us. The sun was still low and a light mist hung in the valley. But it didn’t take much uphill for the temperature to rise.</p>

  <p>A good bacon, eggs, toast, fresh orange juice and coffee did the trick a few kilometres on.</p>
  <img alt="After Leon" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-17-105531.jpg" /> 
  <p>Tired legs, of course, but not as wiped out as yesterday. A sore throat and slight headache portended a cold (hopefully nothing worse, but we had been in closer contact with people) and the hills went slowly. But they went. </p>
  <p>We decided to resume the road route for the rest of the day; we would have had to push too many hills otherwise and, although we weren’t quite in survival mode, we did want to make some progress. There was a long climb up to a pass but it was something of an anti-climax: no sign to tell us we had crested so we were still anticipating it after it had passed. No spectacular views, either. </p>
  <p>But more beautiful countryside – when hasn’t this trip had beautiful scenery?</p>

    <br /> Palas de Rei to Arzúa, Galicia
  </h5>
  (33.3km, 471m, 2403.4 km to date)   
  <p>Rain in the morning so we dillied and dallied. Then went for a fairly substantial breakfast. The rain continued so we wrapped up and set off. It was chilly on the downhill out of town with our speed making the rain feel worse than it was but the climbs were pleasantly warming.</p>
  <p>The first half of the day was along the N547. It had a shoulder but was quite busy with Sunday traffic, not always as respectful as it had been. The rain eased off. A long pull up into the town of Portomarin was not particularly pleasant and we were resigned to more of the same road for the rest of the day. An investigation of Eurovelo 3 showed a quieter-looking route so we changed plans and gambled on less traffic would win out against the likelihood of narrower road shoulders.</p>
  <p>It was a good plan. We were back in the quiet countryside, even if we had earned ourselves a little extra climbing. Eucalyptus plantations abounded.</p>

  <p>The forecast for tomorrow was grim so a rest day seemed in order. Nice Hotel Arzúa and not overly expensive considering the included breakfast.</p>

  <p>We could have continued into Santiago, to the finish; it was only another ten or so kilometres. But it would have had us arriving late in the day so we stopped in a not-so-special lodgings above what looked like a car scrapyard. </p>

    <br /> A Lavacolla to Santiago de Compostela, Galicia
  </h5>
  (10.8km, 176m, 2476.0 km to date) 
  <p>I woke up covered in bites, mainly on my arm and shoulders that had been out of the sheets. Not bedbugs. But quite a rash.</p>
  <p>Due to the bites, I was grumpy in the morning and didn't feel like photographing the evidence. (This photo was taken three days later, after the worst was over. Still a bit grumpy but I may have concentrating more on framing the selfie than looking cheery.)</p>

  <div  class="caption">We're here!</div>
  <p>We arrived in the square in front of the cathedral, the common finishing point for all the various 
  Caminos. I guarded the bikes and Bev went off with our credential passports to obtain our certificates of completion. I was also eligible for a distance certificate since I had come all the way from St Jean Pied-de-Port.</p>

  <p>I'm not sure why my name is Davidem in one and David in the other. Phonetic DavidM perhaps? ;)</p>
  <p>The trip with Bev was over although I still had a couple of weeks. We had a couple of days to lounge in Santiago, and to get Bev's bike packed for the flight back to the UK and then home to Canada.</p>
  <img alt="santiago" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-23-150700.jpg" />
  <p>We went for a wander in the heat of Friday afternoon, through the historical centre of the city and popped in to the cathedral. More wandering, a celebratory sangria, and then back to the cathedral for mass – to signal the end of (the main) Camino really.</p>

  <p>No exciting botofumeiro action, unlike last time, with the censer swooping down from on high to just above our heads. At €300 a pop, the church now reserves this action for special holidays and whenever a group of pilgrims feels flush enough to pony up. No such group this Friday, it seemed.</p>

  <img alt="santiago" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-23-172916.jpg" />
  <p>(The cynic in me might think that they could manage the expense quite easily considering how most of the attendant pilgrims were dropping coins and paper into the collection sack thrust in each of our faces by a scarily no-nonsense older lay-lady.)</p>

  <img alt="santiago" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-23-215625.jpg" />
  <p>It was a special night of some sort, though. When we got back to the square near our rental, crowds were assembled, fish was being barbecued and a bonfire had been built (but not yet lit) on a bed of sand to protect the flagstones. With an early start (for Bev, at least) the next day, we didn’t stay for the fire. Bev heard fireworks later on as we were settling in around midnight.</p>
  <img alt="santiago" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-23-215913.jpg" />
  <p>And then it was the morning of the 24th. Up early to see Bev into her taxi to the airport. I was sad to see her go but it was another beautiful trip together. Forty years and our love just seems to grow stronger.</p>
