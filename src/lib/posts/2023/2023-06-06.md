    <br /> Sansol to Navarrete, La Rioja
    (36.6km, 541m, 1688.0 km to date)

  <div class="caption">Peregrinos everywhere</div>
  <p>Early breakfast but I still managed to delay departure until around 10. Much early climbing on the road but we stopped on the outskirts of/before Viana for a second breakfast/early lunch at 11:30 on purple painted picnic tables.</p>
  <p>We took the pilgrim's route, more gravel and quieter, as far as Lograno. Quite a few peregrin(g)os on the trail today. Lograno was decision time: stay, or continue to Navarrete. We decided to continue, booked a room, posted some postcards and stopped for sustenance as we left Lograno.</p>

  <p> We stopped at a tourist office (tourist offices are Bev's 'thing'). I guarded the bikes (not necessary but a pleasant alternative to trying to converse in Spanish about what there was to see in the town of Logro&ntilde;o). An Italian peregrino stopped to chat. Then Bev and I carried on into town, past the statue of these two peregrinos. Where the Italian caught up to us. He was ending his walk here in Logro&ntilde;o and, having become very attached to his walking stick found somewhere along the way, prevailed upon us to carry his stick until we could place it somewhere prominent, where a pilgrim in need might see it. And possibly take it all the way to Santiago.</p>
  <p>The sky looked very menacing ahead but Bev had been assured at the pilgrim's office that there were only small hills ahead.</p>  
   <p>We stopped in a park on the way out Logro&ntilde;o of for a very late lunch. There wasn't much in the way of accommodation nearby and we decided to press on, fingers crossed that the rumbling thunder wouldn't turn into heavy rain. We deposited the walking stick by a Camino sign and carried on, took a wrong turn and retraced our steps (or, rather, pedal strokes). </p> 
  <p>Of course, "only small hills" is subjective. Having booked a hotel ahead, we were committed. Then a ping from my phone: a message from our 'booked' hotel claimed that nothing was available and the booking had been made in error. Bev looked visibly relieved; we didn't need to ride into that dark night. But we couldn't find anything close so changed plans again and rode on. We made another booking, committed ourselves again.   </p>

  <div class="caption">Still on route</div>
  <p>A long climb, where we barely stayed in front of a couple of female walkers. I was not feeling my strongest.</p>
  <p>The bikes are a real benefit on flat or downhill ground but not so much on the uphill. The effort was all worthwhile;  </p>
  <img alt="Navarre" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-02-170952.jpg" />
  <p>But we did eventually arrive in Navarrote and it was definitely worth the extra 12 km. A nice dinner outside, next to the church (impressive!) capped a long day.</p>

  <p>It was a nice evening to sit outside a restaurant with just a few customers, warm but not hot, and have dinner. I don't remember for certain but there was probably a bottle of wine involved.</p>

    June 3rd, 2023
    <br /> Navarrete to Santa Domingo de la Calzada, La Rioja        
  </h5>
  (38.2km, 472m, 1762.8 km to date)
  <p>No forced early breakfast so a more genteel start today. </p>
  <p>Delayed further by a chat with Michael (ex-Brit, from Ireland now) who wheeled his bike past us as we were leaving.He was riding around Spain until his money ran out. Some talk about the folly of Brexit, of less concern to him now with Irish citizenship. He was enjoying the Camino because of the easier sleeping/dorm opportunities and was regretting carrying a tent since the rocky ground on Spain made driving pegs into the ground virtually impossible. He mentioned considering a bivvy bag so I sold him mine. </p>
   <img alt="La Rioja" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-03-123825.jpg" />
  <p>We took the road route, hoping to get to Santo Domingo de la Calzada. A steep, hot climb up to Sotos, where I discovered I'd left my riding gloves behind, probably on the desk in the hall of the Posada Ignatius, as we were leaving. Damn, they are critical for changing gear with sweaty or wet hands; one disadvantage of a twist-grip shifter. Down to Najera where Google steered me to a bike shop for a new pair of fingerless riding gloves. Except the shop was a church and looked like it had never been a bike shop. Or any kind of shop. But Bev did manage to find some adhesive velcro in a hardware store to fix the sweat band of my helmet, which had come unstuck.</p>
  <p> I also noticed a beautiful dog that we had dined next to in Navarrete. The three ladies accompanying the dog must also be on the Camino; I had assumed them locals, chugging wine and smoking away: not exactly your average peregrinos. </p>

  <p>The afternoon clouds again looked threatening and thunderous rumbles filled the air but we plodded upwards, and then down into Santo Domingo and our accommodation.</p>
  <p>There seemed to be a sporting event on a pitch adjacent to the road as we entered the city. One supporter was enwrapped in a tuba (or so it seemed from our vantage point on the road). Later, we saw a football game on a muddy pitch on the TV. The same match: the tuba player was in evidence. The final score was 3-0, or 0-3, so I'm not sure who won. But when we walked to dinner, crowds were out to support the local team so I'm assuming the game was of some import.</p>

  <p>It was straight into a long hill on a busy road immediately from the hotel. Fortunately, a shoulder appeared after a few hundred yards. It was a steady uphill slog, two hundred metres vertical gained, into pine forest. Not that I really noticed to forest, my eyes glued to the pavement in front of my front wheel. Bev lead the way so traffic could hit me first; sheâ€™s starting to get her hill legs! <span class="entity">ðŸ™‚</span></p>
  <img alt="Approaching Burgos" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-05-121413.jpg" />
  <p>There was some level riding where I could appreciate to woodland surroundings and then pleasant and sustained downhill pretty much for the rest of the day. We managed to avoid most of the traffic, riding on Camino gravel paths off to the side although we didnâ€™t see any walkers today.</p>
  <img alt="Approaching Burgos" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-05-123626.jpg" />
  <p>Some bikes, pretty much all electric. There certainly seem to be more e-bikes than non-assisted on the Camino and often driven/ridden by kids even younger than us.</p>
  <img alt="Approaching Burgos" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-05-135357.jpg" />
  <p>A red bike trail led us into the town of Burgos, through pleasant parks. Weâ€™re going to spend two nights here. Time for a mini-break.</p>
