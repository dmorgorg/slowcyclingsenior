    <br /> Pamplona to Puente la Reina
    (34.6km, 504m, 1602.6 km to date)
  </h5>
  <p>One thousand miles since Greenwich!</p>
  <Callout>I’ve already been on the real Camino, from Saint Jean Pied-de-Port. But, for me, the Camino that I had long looked forward to starts here, with Bev beside me. Our cycling trips together have been magical and I have no doubt that this will be as good as any of the others.</Callout>

  <p>A few last minute adjustments, mainly to bikes and we were off around 11:30 am. A gentle ride out of town with only a few mis-steps, thanks in large part to excellent signage for both walking and cycling peregrinos.</p>

  <p>Then lots of ups and downs, mainly ups, through beautiful countryside. Green fields and poppies in abundance.</p>

  <p>A significant amount of gravel road and tracks: very pleasant but more tiring. One steep section on rocky terrain encouraged us both to get off and push although this didn’t prove to be that much easier. The rough ground was particularly taxing on my gammy ankle.</p>

  <p>We were high enough at one point to go through pine forest, and there was evidence not far away of recent forest fires (which I assume were not controlled burns). Another delightful section took us down a path between and beneath an extended arch of tree-cover that would provide welcome shade on a hot day to foot-weary pilgrims.</p>

  <p>Speaking of which: it was quite a hot day, sunny with ominously dark clouds threatening and rumbling but never actually following through on their threats. Luckily.</p>

  <p>Hotel Rural Bidean provided comfortable lodgings and food for us. The food seemed a bit pricy by peregrino standards so we may need to look further afield in future. That said, it’s hard to wander off, hungry, in search of a better deal after a tiring day of travel when there is food available in front of you.</p>
  <p>After dinner, we went for a relaxed stroll, down to the Puente (bridge) which look very elegant in the evening light. It’s probably looked very elegant for a few hundred years now.</p>
