    August 8th, 2022 <br/>
    Hook of Holland to den Haag, Zuid-Holland    
  </h5>(24.4 km, 95 m, 255.3 km to date)
  <br /> 
  <p>We spilled off the ferry, somewhat bleary-eyed, at 0700 English time after a short but comfortable night. We'd had a meal after the ferry got under way at 2300 and were in bed before 0100. An announcement that breakfast was being served came much too early at 0530 and was ignored but there was no getting back to sleep.</p>
  <p>After a while sitting on the pavement wondering what exactly do and where exactly to go, our phones recognised that we were in a different country and connected us to the local network. We decided that den Haag/The Hague was a suitable destination for our first day on the continent, and off we wobbled. Beautifully wide cycle paths led us out of the Hook of Holland and northward. After playing in the traffic in England, this felt like a different planet. Bikes everywhere. Mostly passing us. More than half were electric. We mostly followed the coast route (LF Kustroute, also part of EV12) before heading off the route and into den Haag.</p>

  <p>There were a few moments of confusion when I first encountered a cyclepath-roundabout, wrapped around a motor vehicle roundabout. To the consternation of other cyclists, I didn't initially realise that you had to ride in the same dirction as the traffic, namely counter-clockwise. There was some vigorous bell-ringing directed at me as I attempted to make a left turn the 'short' way. I (hopefully) won't make that mistake again. </p>
  <p>Wow, the cyclists have right of way on their roundabout with cars stopping to let them pass!</p>

  <p>After settling into our hotel, we went for a wander around in search of dinner. A hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant exceeded all expectations. So far, we're pretty happy with the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Day two in den Haag involved a visit to MauritsHuis, to look at some pictures (in the rather vain attempt at imbuing me with a modicum of culture).
