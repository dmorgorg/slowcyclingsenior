  <p>No words, no pictures. What happened to today? I have no recollection apart from a holiday camp style campground and a night in the tent. A warm one, too. From the cycle route map, it appears that we followed the coast. Then camped, with no description of the days exertions and/or highlights forthcoming.</p>

    Noordwijkerhout to Amsterdam, Nord-Holland    
  </h5>
  (45.2 km, 118 m, 333.3 km to date)
  <p>A good night in the tent but it got warm early and I was dripping by the time that the tent was stowed and we were ready to head out and explore more of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
 I entered "current location" and "Mercure Amsterdam City Hotel" into https://cycle.travel on my phone and let cycle.travel generate a cycle-friendly route away from the coast to our Amsterdam hotel. Then I downloaded the .gpx file, opened the file in my Wahoo Elemnt app and passed it wirelessly to my handlebar cycle computer (a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt). It sounds complicated but, in a few minutes, the route was in my cycle computer, ready to guide us through our day.

  To pre-empt any complaints that fellow cyclists sometimes direct at those who 'depend' upon electronics to navigate, let me state that I have used old-school paper maps for navigation for the last half century or so. It is, no doubt, a handy skill to have. But modern technology does have many advantages: it tells me where I am currently located and where to turn next, allowing me the freedom to gaze around and take in the surroundings, whether they be countryside or town. And the countryside was very pleasant to look at. Backstreet detours through towns en route would have been very difficult to find, let alone to navigate through, requiring 110% concentration on a paper map and then still likely to result in error and backtracking. True, I didn't generally know the name of the settlement we were passing through and that would have been readily available on a paper map - but I would not have remembered the name anyway!
<p>After a couple of kilometres, we came to the StayOkay youth hostel, where Bev arranged a couple of sandwiches each and coffee for me. It was very pleasant sitting outside, eating a leisurely breakfast in the shade, trying not to think too much about the hot day cycling ahead.</p>
But the day ahead, hot though it certainly felt, was very pleasant. The Netherlands certainly looks after their cyclists; our route was about 85% on cycle routes separated from the roads that the cars and trucks used. Most of the remaining 15% was along cycle lanes, separated only from the courteous traffic by a painted line.

The countryside was fairly densely populated but with fields of flowers and grain. Canals and drainage ditches were everywhere, with much of our route alongside these waterways. There were the usual complaints from me (sore knees, sore bum) and it was hot but we enjoyed it still. Not a long day but we were happy to check into our air-conditioned hotel for a few days in Amsterdam.

  We spent yesterday wandering around the city, in the heat, with our friends Bernd and Katja who had driven up from Dresden to meet us. (We were headed to Dresden but it would take us a few weeks, not a long day's drive.) Not so much a rest day: Bernd and Katja have very much too much energy.

 <p> A metro and a bus transported Bev and I to Molen van Sloten to view a working windmill. Very much more interesting than it sounds! </p>

When draining an area of marshland, a canal is first cut around the area. Then a windmill is built on a high part of the marsh, to pump water into the canal for removal to the sea. When the higher part of the marshland is sufficiently drained of water, a second, lower windmill is built to drain a lower section, pumping water to the first, higher windmill and then on to the sea. And so on.

The horizontal rotation of the mill blades' axle is converted to a vertical rotation down this square axle using a couple of cog wheels. An Archimedes screw (not working today because there has been no rain for weeks and there is no need to pump water) is able is able to move 60,000 litres/min. (1.0 m<sup>3</sup>/s)

It was a fun tour, and educational. Our guide was a spry old lady, in her seventies (I presume, maybe older, still nipping up and down the steep stairs that are almost ladders) with a ready smile.
<p></p>
The windmill has not been in use for a few weeks due to lack of recent rain. This drought is affecting much of Europe, with the Rhine levels so low that water traffic, a major commercial artery, has been reduced. And I read reports of taps running dry in Sussex (UK) today. Or was it Suffolk?

We wandered briefly through the village before returning to Amsterdam city for a visit to the Museum of Canals. Educational again, though not as compelling to me.

And, finally, a very nice dinner with Bernd and Katja.
