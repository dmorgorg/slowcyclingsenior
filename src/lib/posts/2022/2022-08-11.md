  <p>No words, no pictures. What happened to today? I have no recollection apart from a holiday camp style campground and a night in the tent. A warm one, too. From the cycle route map, it appears that we followed the coast. Then camped, with no description of the days exertions and/or highlights forthcoming.</p>

    den Haag, Zuid-Holland    
  </h5>

  <p>Day two in den Haag involved a visit to MauritsHuis, to look at some pictures (in the rather vain attempt at imbuing me with a modicum of culture).</p>
  <div class="w-90"><img alt="MuaritsHuis" src="/images/2022/08/1600/2022-08-09-065602.jpg" /><br/>
  <div class="caption">MauritsHuis</div></div>
  <p>The exhibits were a strange mix of classical and contemporary interpretations of some of the classics:</p>

  <p>This modern interpretation of the four Marys proved too much for Facebook's 'nudity' filter (and for a few ardent Christians too, I suspect). It's a shame that FB is not so clever when it comes to removing misinformation. </p>

  <p>And, of course, the girl we had all come to see!</p>

  <p>We like the feel of den Haag, and the Dutch people in general. The only disappointment was that, when we went back to the Thai restaurant, we found that it was closed on Tuesdays!</p>
