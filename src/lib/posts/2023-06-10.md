  <p>A wonderful day. Easy, steady riding along the Camino, packed gravel mainly. High plain (meseta) with wind turbines, green barley and red poppies. Lots of poppies. Quite a few pilgrims and the most bikes weâ€™ve seen yet. And not the usual preponderance of e-bikes; I only saw one today. Iâ€™ll let the pictures do (most of) the talking <span class="entity">ðŸ™‚</span></p>
  <p>Simple and well-signposted to get out of Burgos.</p>
  <img alt="Leaving Burgos" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-07-113225.jpg" /> 
  <p>Then a slow climb up to unspoilt, magnificent, wide open countryside. A good surface to ride on (and, hopefully, to walk on).</p>

  <p>A minimal breakfast and then out to check out the church dominating our alburgue before setting off. Itâ€™s often a surprise that a uniformly earth-toned church exterior can house such treasures (especially if one can, for the moment, disregard the pain for the locals often conscripted into the construction of such magnificent structures) in otherwise simple and poor villages.</p>
