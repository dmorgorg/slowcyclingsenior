    <br /> Burgos to Castrojeriz, Castilla y Le&oacute;n
    (41.0km, 349m, 1876.5 km to date)   
  </h5>
  <p/>

  <p>A wonderful day. Easy, steady riding along the Camino, packed gravel mainly. High plain (meseta) with wind turbines, green barley and red poppies. Lots of poppies. Quite a few pilgrims and the most bikes weâ€™ve seen yet. And not the usual preponderance of e-bikes; I only saw one today. Iâ€™ll let the pictures do (most of) the talking <span class="entity">ðŸ™‚</span></p>
  <p>Simple and well-signposted to get out of Burgos.</p>
  <img alt="Leaving Burgos" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-07-113225.jpg" /> 
  <p>Then a slow climb up to unspoilt, magnificent, wide open countryside. A good surface to ride on (and, hopefully, to walk on).</p>

    <br /> Castrojeriz to VillalcÃ¡zar de Sirga, Castilla y Le&oacute;n
    (40.8 km, 352 m, 1917.3 km to date)   
  </h5>

  <p>A minimal breakfast and then out to check out the church dominating our alburgue before setting off. Itâ€™s often a surprise that a uniformly earth-toned church exterior can house such treasures (especially if one can, for the moment, disregard the pain of the locals conscripted into the construction of such magnificent structures) in otherwise simple and poor villages.</p>

  <p>A lot of sweat and tears went into reaching the top of this hill. One very fit looking cyclist proudly and loudly made it to the top without dismounting but he wasn't loaded for touring. But we were on a lovely high plain (known as the Meseta), an area intimidating for the walkers but very pleasant for us on two-wheeled steeds.</p>
  <p>With long stages and empty landscapes, the roughly 200 km of the northern Meseta between Burgos and Le&oacute;n are hot in summer and cold in winter, wide open and deserted. It is a daunting week or so for the averagely-paced pilgrim.</p>
  <img alt="" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-115005.jpg" />
  <p>Pleasant, level Camino gravel lead to an even steeper downhill, which didnâ€™t look much fun for the walkers edging their way downwards, carefully guarding their knees. The 18% was concreted so it was straightforward on the bikes.</p>
  <img alt="" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-115503.jpg" />
  <p>There was some light rain but it didnâ€™t amount to much. Again, a beautiful day almost as pretty as the previous one.</p>
   <img alt="" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-131349.jpg" />
   <p>A short section followed the Canal de Castilla, no longer navigable and now used primarily for irrigation.</p>
   <img alt="weirs along the Canal de Castilla" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-145211.jpg" />
   <p>Then, to finish the day, a long section of straight and very slightly climbing tarmac. We could have taken the adjacent pilgrim gravel path (senda) but there was little traffic so pedalling along the road was easier.</p>
   <img alt="afternoon clouds building on the meseta" src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-162216.jpg" />
   <div class="caption">Afternoon clouds building over the Meseta</div>
   <p>It was a busy day on the Camino: lots of pilgrims walking and more bikes than we had seen before. In contrast to the previous day, most were electric. But along the senda (a pilgrim path parallel to the road), in the mid to late afternoon, pilgrims were in short supply. Having, presumably, completed their daily objective.</p>
   <p>Five or six kilometres before our objective for the day, I led off-piste to visit a church that had been visible for a while. We went inside...</p>
   <img alt="church altar " src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-165336.jpg" />
   <img alt="stained glass window " src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-165730.jpg" />
   <img alt="modern stained glass " src="/images/2023/06/1600/2023-06-08-165631.jpg" />
   <p>...and whilst inside enjoying more spectacularly designed ceilings and roof work, the heavens opened. For once, the dark brooding afternoon sky delivered.</p>
   <p>When we came out of the church, water was cascading off the church roof onto our bikes. And just about everything else, too. We were trapped for a while, then it began to ease and we could see the hill in the distance we still had to pass to finish the day. Then more lighting and almost simultaneous thunderclaps with the storm virtually overhead.</p>
   <p>The hotel across from the church looked inviting. And was inexpensiveâ€¦ Maybe weâ€™ll get some photos of the outside of the church in the morning. Some of it looks ready to fall down.</p>

   <p>A pleasant breakfast in the bar below our room, then pointed the camera briefly at the church before pointing ourselves up the hill on the N120.</p>

   <p>This fellow and his buddy mark the â€˜geographicalâ€™ centre of the Camino route. Although Iâ€™m not quite sure what is meant by geographical centre. Presumably not the halfway point for walking/riding &ndash; I think we're past that. (I suspect that the straight-line distance from here to St Jean Pied-de-Port is the same as the straight-line distance to Santiago de Compostela.)</p>

   <p>A good spot for a late (4:00pm) lunch!</p>
