<h5>
  	25th February, 2024.<br/>
  	Opting out of the hike up Lion Rock
</h5>

<p>My ankle continues to hurt, especially on sloping ground. It's worse barefoot, as required in some of the holy sites, but is generally a challenge. Lion Rock, the 'thing' at Sigiriya, has about 1200 steps, many high and narrow. I decided to get some extra sleep while Bev went out, with Leel, to try to catch sunrise at the top of the rock.</p>
<p>They were the first at the ticket counter, in the dark at 5:00 am, and amongst the first on the summit. It looks an interesting place. Bev was back, tired, hungry and exhilarated around 9:00 so I figured it was time to get out of bed and go for breakfast.</p>
<p>We stayed at a nice homestay, in the countryside a couple of kilometres from Sigiriya. A lovely couple with two young boys. And a daughter, whom we didn't see, who had just given birth four days earlier to a baby girl. The mum of the house, now grandma, was an excellent cook and provided very nice evening meals.</p>
<p>After breakfast, out for a tuktuk tour of the area.</p>

<p>A night shelter for watchmen, keeping an eye open for elephants. Which are persuaded to leave with fireworks. Elephants do much damage to crops.</p>

<p>The hill on the left is much lower than Lion Rock on the right. It offers good views of Lion Rock, apparently, and doesn't have the large tourist fee that Lion Rock has.</p>

<p>Bev and Leel were happy to have avoided the crowds we could see later in the day. It was still only about noon so these people descending probably started about 9:00 am.</p>

<h5>
  	26th February, 2024.<br/>
  	A drive from Sigiriya to Kandy, with an important stop along the way.
</h5>

<p>Dambulla, which I had cycled through a few weeks earlier but neglected to visit in my hurry to reach Colombo in time for Bev's arrival, is an important part of any Sri Lankan cultural tour. Of course, it involved climbing up far too many steps (although only one-third as many as I'd avoided by sleeping through Bev's ascent of Lion Rock) but it did seem manageable for this old crock.</p>

<p>And WOW! It would have been a great mistake to have missed this. We shed our shoes at the top of the stairs, at the entrance to the site, and entered the nearest (and smallest) of five caves. It contained a large reclining Buddha that took up much of the room, a standing Buddha, and many paintings on the walls and ceiling of the cave.</p>

<img

<img

  alt="buddha, dambulla"
/>

<p>The cave was small and people had to squeeze by each other. It was also extremely hot, probably exacerbated by the recent climb. I didn't linger.</p>

  alt="lotus pond, dambulla"
/>

<p>The fourth cave is supposedly the most impressive so we went to the furthest (number 1) to work our way back. And these four caves were very special, containing many Buddha statues (more than 150 in total) and innumerable (not in a strictly mathematical sense) paintings of Buddha on the walls and ceilings of the caves.</p>

<p>And then on to Kandy, with a mandatory tourist stop at an ayurvedic spice centre en route.</p>
<p>Another mandatory stop: the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, an important place for Sri Lankan Buddhists to visit but the relic was hidden away.</p>

<p>It was a long day for Leel with lots of driving. He dropped us at our lodgings (not quite a hotel, not really a homestay) and went to find somewhere for himself to sleep. We cleaned up, then took a tuktuk down for a splendid masala dosai. Lassi. Chai... :) </p>
<p>Kandy seems busy, urban. Noisy. Very hilly. Not a particularly attractive location to spend a lot of time. A slightly seedy hill-station vibe.</p>
