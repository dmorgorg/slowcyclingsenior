<h5>
  	25th February, 2024.<br/>
  	Opting out of the hike up Lion Rock
</h5>

<p>My ankle continues to hurt, especially on sloping ground. It's worse barefoot, as required in some of the holy sites, but is generally a challenge. Lion Rock, the 'thing' at Sigiriya, has about 1200 steps, many high and narrow. I decided to get some extra sleep while Bev went out, with Leel, to try to catch sunrise at the top of the rock.</p>
<p>They were the first at the ticket counter, in the dark at 5:00 am, and some of the first on the summit. It looks an interesting place. Bev was back, tired, hungry and exhilarated around 9:00 so I figured it was time to get out of bed and go for breakfast.</p>
<p>We stayed at a nice homestay, in the countryside a couple of kilometres from Sigiriya. A lovely couple with two young boys. And a daughter, whom we didn't see, who had just given birth four days earlier to a baby girl. The mum of the house, now grandma, was an excellent cook and provided very nice evening meals.</p>
<p>After breakfast, out for a tuktuk tour of the area.</p>

<p>A night shelter for watchmen, keeping an eye open for elephants. Which are persuaded to leave with fireworks. Elephants do much damage to crops.</p>

<p>The hill on the left is much lower than Lion Rock on the right. It offers good views of Lion Rock, apparently, and doesn't have the large tourist fee that Lion Rock has.</p>

<p>Bev and Leel were happy to have avoided the crowds we could see later in the day. It was still only about noon so these people descending probably started about 9:00 am.</p>

<p>The sign warns of elephants in the evening. </p>
