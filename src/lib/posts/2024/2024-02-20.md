<h5>
  	18th February, 2024.
  	 By road, to Wilpattu
</h5>

<p>Our driver Jayesinghe (Leel) arrived with his Honda Fit Hybrid Shuttle at around 10:00 am as scheduled and we set off across the city. And out of the city, northward, but it still seemed pretty well populated and built up. Being Sunday, the traffic was light.</p>

<p>We stopped at a Catholic church in the region of Negombo where, on Good Friday less than five years ago, an IS suicide bomber wiped out both himself and the congregation. Similar suicide bombings occurred simultaneously in two other Catholic churches and three luxury hotels. There were a total of 269 fatalities, but the majority of the deaths seemed to have been here, at the church we visited.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the church is already rebuilt and, apart from a section on a pillar and a section on the floor deliberately preserved, there was no evidence of the carnage that had taken place here so recently. A light, airy church open on three sides, full of carefree schoolchildren in their blue trousers and skirts, and their white shirts. Nice understated modern stained glass and a pretty representation of the last supper. I found it (very) moving that such evil could have been perpetrated here in 2019 and, yet, the atmosphere here and now was so positive. There was some security, and we couldn't take photographs, but apart from that everything had a regular Sunday afternoon feel to it.</p>

<p>Bev noticed an impressive Hindu temple as we were continuing. Our driver stopped for us to have a look around. It was colourful and nicely decorated. We were not allowed into the impressive inner temple, not quite the "inner sanctum" I think, but reserved for practising Hindus.</p>

<p>We began to appreciate an advantage of having a driver, having opportunities to stop and have some limited explorations that would not otherwise have been possible. And some local knowledge was helpful. We stopped for 'rambutan,' a fruit somewhat similar to the lychee, but with a red spiny skin. I'd been seeing those on my bike but hadn't known what they were, or how to eat them.</p>

<p>Fisherpeople, in the Pattulam area. They were spashing rocks onto the surface of the water, presumably to drive their potential catch in nets or pens we couldn't see.</p>

<p>Our 'resort' is not so resorty, which is just fine. Roshan was very welcoming, our room is very comfortable and a nice buffet rounded out the day. There were mainly Westerners in attendance, eating outside, maybe twenty or so. I had a beer and Bev a bottle of wine. She had been thinking of a glass but a bottle appeared. We managed, somehow.</p>

  	20th February, 2024. <br/>
  	Wilpattu to Annaradhapura.
  </h5>
  <p>We had planned a day on the road up to Jaffna but decided at the last moment to go as far as Annaradapura and see some of the 'sights' there, rather than detour on the way down towards the mountains.</p>
  <p>Bev got to experience enjoying milk from a coconut at a roadside stall.</p>

  <p>Leel met up with a 'friend,' a local guide, who toured us around the usual circuit, bombarding us with numbers and dates and words that didn't register. What did register, and painfully so, was the heat that cooked our bare feet when we had to take off our shoes at holy sites. I can now well understand how people who fell over in Phoenix, Arizona, during a recent unusually (probably the new 'usual') hot summer, got third degree burns trying to get up again. Our trials, of course, were not so extreme but definitely extreme enough to feel to bottoms of my feet frying. Combined with the extra difficulty of walking on my bad ankle without sandal support, it wasn't a lot of fun. Very, very hot as well. It was hard to appreciate the culture under these conditions, especially for an uncultured soul like myself. At one return to the vehicle to move to the next not-to-be-missed marvel, Bev and I dug out some socks which help with the feet.</p>

  <p>The original Bohdi tree was in Bihar, India. Siddhartha Gautama (later known as Buddha) meditated under it while attaining enlightenment. In 236 BC, the daughter of Ashoka the Great, brought a cutting of the tree to Annaradhapura; at 2300 years, it is now thought to be the oldest living human planted tree. (We learned all this, and more, from our guide. But I retained little and am now resorting to Wikipedia.)</p>

  <p>The Jetavanarama Stupa is the largest brick structure in the world. 122 metres in height, it was the third highest structure in the world, behind the two great pyramids in Egypt, when built in the third century. It was overgrown by jungle in the 11th century and renovated to its current height (of 71 metres) in the 12th century.</p>
