<h5>Salamanca. 21st May, 2024</h5>

<p>Given the splendour and relative value of my five-star lodging, and the ache in my legs, it wasn't too difficult a decision: a day to explore Salamanca! Coffee, with a toasted croissant with butter and jam, at a place I'd noticed the evening before. &euro;3.80 well-spent, especially compared with the &euro;13 that the hotel wanted for breakfast. </p>

<p>First stop was at the Plaza Mayor. This was a contained square, with high building on each side. There were wooden shacks, selling books, in the centre of the square, with detracted from the overall impression. (As I had seen in Le&oacute;n)</p>

<p>Nice golden stone gives all the old buildings a pleasing, warm feeling.</p>

<p>Spain is full of sculptures. Art of various kinds. Darth Vader, a priest or a peregrino?</p>

<p>So much for rest day. 200 steps with sore knees. Nice views of the city make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>An then, through the new cathedral, to the old. More understated than the new.</p>

</h5>

<p>Peregrinos are up at seven, and out of the albergue by eight, I learned. Not me, but I aimed for around nine. Coffee, bread and marmalade. Then photos with J&eacute;sus, the hospitalero, and exchange of contact details. J&eacute;sus will be back in his home, Sevilla, at the end of the month and can show me around. It takes several days, he told me. Not in my schedule. Let's see how things work out: Eurovelo 1 skirts Sevilla altogether and cuts the corner on its way to Portugal.</p>

<p>A quick climb (8 m) back up to the rail-trail I'd left the evening before: Via Verde, or the Green Way. This is not the route in my cycling guide but appears to be on Eurovelo 1. And recommended by a couple of locals who had popped round to talke to J&eacute;sus the previous evening.</p>

</div>

<p>Gentle coasting down, rarely a pedal stroke. An excellent start to the day. Almost immediately out of Castilla y Le&oacute;n and into Extremadura.</p>

<p.>Into a tunnel, blackness and a damp, softer surface that grabbed at my front wheel, had me wondering where I'd stashed my headlight. Front bag, I think. Then, on popped the tunnel lights...</p.>

<p>After about 10 km, a sign indicated just 58 km more to Galisteo; that seemed a reasonable destination for the day. Since much of it appeared to be downhill. I had only planned as far as Plasencia but went ahead and booked a room in Gastileo instead. There weren't many available and it was Friday so there might be some last minute weekend custom.</p>

<p>The math didn't quite work out, but that point escaped me. I'd covered about 10 km of an 80 km stage but there was only 58 km to go? </p>

<p>There were a few other cyclists, mainly small groups on mountain bike. A couple going northward, uphill. Apart from that, I had the trail to myself. It was pretty, not yet hot, and about as good as it can get!</p>
