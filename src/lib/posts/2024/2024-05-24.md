<h5>Salamanca. 21st May, 2024</h5>

<p>Given the splendour and relative value of my five-star lodging, and the ache in my legs, it wasn't too difficult a decision: a day to explore Salamanca! Coffee, with a toasted croissant with butter and jam, at a place I'd noticed the evening before. &euro;3.80 well-spent, especially compared with the &euro;13 that the hotel wanted for breakfast. </p>

<p>First stop was at the Plaza Mayor. This was a contained square, with high building on each side. There were wooden shacks, selling books, in the centre of the square, with detracted from the overall impression. (As I had seen in Le&oacute;n)</p>

<p>Nice golden stone gives all the old buildings a pleasing, warm feeling.</p>

<p>Spain is full of sculptures. Art of various kinds. Darth Vader, a pilgrim or a priest?</p>
