<p>Le&oacute;n is on the Camino Franc&eacute;s so there had been peregrinos around. I would be sharing the route with the peregrinos for a few hours today.</p>

<p>A shorter day today, so I decided to try out the gravel routing option from <a href="https://cycle.travel"> cycle.travel</a> What a joy!</p>

<p>Almost immediately, I was on a well-graded gravel road, between freshly planted fields with seeds starting to poke through. It was harder riding, none of the smooth pavement, and my speed was down a few kph. But I was where I wanted to be, in the countryside. No traffic. Wide open vistas. Varied enough to keep me happy.</p>

<p>Some was rockier than it needed to be. You can't have everything. Yet this was pretty damn close!</p>

<p>If I was still teaching courses in water resources, I would have 'measured' the width and the side slope of the canal, and dropped some floatable vegetation into it to estimate the velocity of the flow. Then I could calculate the slope of the channel. But, if I were still teaching, I wouldn't be here. I'd be in a windowless classroom. I would, most definitely, rather be where I am right now! </p>

<Callout>I do sometimes &ndash; briefly &ndash; regret no longer teaching. Daily interaction with young adults is a privilege, and keeps you on your toes. There is little to no chance that I will teach again and, when I think about it, I am happier for tahat. Not the teaching, not the students, but the dealing with administration and managers.

<p>Mustard is being grown here, I think. The poles in the background is for irrigation. Despite the wet weather of the last few days.</p>

<p>I had to adlib a bit. My route would indicate left or right occasionally along roads that no longer existed, as one or the other field had encroached. But, generally, if I headed south when this occurred, I was still going in the direction I wanted. Or that seemed to be the pattern until... </p>

<p>...the generous, wide and graded dirt deteriorated...

<p>...until there was little gravel to be seen.

<p>A thistle barrier paused progress. This is the one occasion when I wish I had not been wearing Chaco sandals. But at least I didn't end up with thistles clinging to my socks. And the barrier was easily skirted.</p>

<p>The gravel route was slow, and it was easy to stop for photographs. Perhaps I overdid it with the camera. But this is a day I don't want to forget &ndash; and at my age, a visual reminder is always useful! Also, the route and views were varied and I'd like to show this.</p>

<p>I was having a wonderful time. Early on, I had passed a tractor and a truck parked on the wide gravel road. Two men, one adding fluid to the tractor. Since then, I had seen no-one. Quiet, beautiful, solitary riding. On a varied surface that beats tarmac any day! At least on a day like this. If I'd had further to go, tarmac might have helped but I was enjoying the scenery and solitude too much.</p>

<p>For a while, my dirt path paralleled a paved road with significant traffic. Then, at a crossroads, a transport truck came to a halt. A man, leading a huge flock of sheep, went by the truck. He saw me, and shouted for me (I presume) to move, he was coming my way. I rode on and paused to watch as his flock of several hundred sheep dispersed into a field to eat the remaining stalks after harvest. I hadn't seen sheep, in numbers greater than ten or so, yet. Different sheep, too: grubby, off-white.</p>

<p>Yes, there are humans around. Not very many, but one was loading this hay truck.</p>

<p>The rain, when it came, was not too serious. It was cool enough for me to put on a fleece under my rain jacket but not so bad that I put on waterproof pants over my shorts.</p>

<p>A spectacular day. If I can get some more like this, I'll be a happy <s>camper</s>rider.</p>
