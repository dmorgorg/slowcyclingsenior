<p>Le&oacute;n is on the Camino Franc&eacute;s so there had been peregrinos around. I would be sharing the route with the peregrinos for a few hours today.</p>

  	Santa Maria del P&aacute;ramar - Benavente<br/>
    (52.8 km, 217 m, 2355.3 km to date)
</h5>

<p>A shorter day today, so I decided to try out the gravel routing option from <a href="https://cycle.travel"> cycle.travel</a> What a joy!</p>

<p>Almost immediately, I was on a well-graded gravel road, between freshly planted fields with seeds starting to poke through. It was harder riding, none of the smooth pavement, and my speed was down a few kph. But I was where I wanted to be, in the countryside. No traffic. Wide open vistas. Varied enough to keep me happy.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/05/2024-05-17-110211.jpg"
  alt="gravel road" 
/>

<p>Some was rockier than it needed to be. You can't have everything. Yet this was pretty damn close!</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/05/2024-05-17-111622.jpg"
  alt="gravel road" 
/>

<p>If I was still teaching courses in water resources, I would have 'measured' the width and the side slope of the canal, and dropped some floatable vegetation into it to estimate the velocity of the flow. Then I could calculate the slope of the channel. But, if I were still teaching, I wouldn't be here. I'd be in a windowless classroom. I would, most definitely, rather be where I am right now! </p>

<Img

  alt="trapezoidal open channel"

<Callout>I do sometimes &ndash; briefly &ndash; regret no longer teaching. Daily interaction with young adults is a privilege, and keeps you on your toes. There is little to no chance that I will teach again and, when I think about it, I am happier for tahat. Not the teaching, not the students, but the dealing with administration and managers.
</Callout>

<p>Mustard is being grown here, I think. The poles in the background is for irrigation. Despite the wet weather of the last few days.</p>

  alt="mustard growing in a field" 
  caption="Mustard?"

<p>I had to adlib a bit. My route would indicate left or right occasionally along roads that no longer existed, as one or the other field had encroached. But, generally, if I headed south when this occurred, I was still going in the direction I wanted. Or that seemed to be the pattern until... </p>

<p>...the generous, wide and graded dirt deteriorated...

<Img
  src="/images/2024/05/2024-05-17-115742.jpg"
  alt="gravel"

<p>...until there was little gravel to be seen.

<p>A thistle barrier paused progress. This is the one occasion when I wish I had not been wearing Chaco sandals. But at least I didn't end up with thistles clinging to my socks. And the barrier was easily skirted.</p>

<p>The gravel route was slow, and it was easy to stop for photographs. Perhaps I overdid it with the camera. But this is a day I don't want to forget &ndash; and at my age, a visual reminder is always useful! Also, the route and views were varied and I'd like to show this.</p>

  alt="flowers"

<p>I was having a wonderful time. Early on, I had passed a tractor and a truck parked on the wide gravel road. Two men, one adding fluid to the tractor. Since then, I had seen no-one. Quiet, beautiful, solitary riding. On a varied surface that beats tarmac any day! At least on a day like this. If I'd had further to go, tarmac might have helped but I was enjoying the scenery and solitude too much.</p>

<p>For a while, my dirt path paralleled a paved road with significant traffic. Then, at a crossroads, a transport truck came to a halt. A man, leading a huge flock of sheep, went by the truck. He saw me, and shouted for me (I presume) to move, he was coming my way. I rode on and paused to watch as his flock of several hundred sheep dispersed into a field to eat the remaining stalks after harvest. I hadn't seen sheep, in numbers greater than ten or so, yet. Different sheep, too: grubby, off-white.</p>

<p>Yes, there are humans around. Not very many, but one was loading this hay truck.</p>

<p>The rain, when it came, was not too serious. It was cool enough for me to put on a fleece under my rain jacket but not so bad that I put on waterproof pants over my shorts.</p>

<p>A spectacular day. If I can get some more like this, I'll be a happy <s>camper</s> rider.</p>

<h5>Benavente. 18th May, 2024.</h5>

<p>I awoke feeling tired and opted for a rest day. After all, the food was good. And cheap. And the wine plentiful. But my hotel was showing up on Booking.com &ndash; it was Saturday, and fully booked? I asked downstairs and learned that, unfortunately, "hotal completo." At least, that's what I thought the man behind the bar said after checking the computer. The hotel across the road, where my bike was stored, also showed full on booking.com so it looked like, after all, I was fated to ride. The forecast was for rain.</p>

<p>I packed up and left my panniers by the door and went to collect my bike. On the off chance, I asked the lady if they had a room. Her initial response was "No" but, thinking for a while, showed me a very nice looking room on the ground floor. It was a suite of three bedrooms, with only one (mine) open. A shared bathroom, shared with the other two empty rooms. I smiled, proffered my passport and credit card, went to pick up my panniers. </p>

<p>I walked into town, took a few photographs of the church, and returned in the drizzle to my original hotel, the Hostal Restaurante La Trucha (the Trout) for a glass of Radler (beer with a lemon hint, almost a shandy), then over to my new home, the Hotel Santiago, to process some pictures and update my blog (this blog) a little. I returned at nine for dinner; the room was made up for a large party but there were a couple of tables available at one side. Again, nice if not spectacular food, nice wine and a nice price.</p>

<h5>
  	19th May, 2024.
  	Benavente - Zamora<br/>
    (67.4 km, 327 m, 2422.7 km to date)
</h5>

<p>My guidebook wasn't too excited about the off-road section for today's ride, until the end which was better. Since I'm going in the opposite direction, I chose the off-road option to start. And it was a very pleasant start to the day. </p>

<p>No matter how nice the scenery, I much prefer the off-road options. It's as though the road is about getting the miles done and the trails are about enjoying the ride. Also the scenery is generally better on the trail than on the road, and it is closer &ndash; not behind some guardrail or down an embankment. It's easier to stop for photographs. The riding is harder off-road, and my already slow speed is a few kilometres per hour slower, but it feels more like what I am touring for. </p>

<p>Even on the quiet N-630, which follows very closely to the pilgrims Via Ruta de la Plata, there is still traffic to contend with. Not much: it's wonderfully quiet by usual road standards now that almost all the traffic uses the nearby Autovia instead, but cars do still pass. Often at a high speed. They are (almost all) courteous and give me plenty of room. It's hard to imagine big semi-trucks moving completely into the far lane to give me space in England or back home in Canada. (To be fair, there is too much traffic in England for that generally to be an option.)</p>

<p>But the off-road options can also be too hard. For me. That painful day, all climbing, over the pass from Asturias into Castilla y Le&oacute;n had me riding and pushing for an elevation gain of 1100 metres. The off-road alternative was almost twice that. With more food and time, I could have made an adventure of it, camping out in my bivvy-sac. Maybe when I'm fitter...</p>

<p>And I get more saddle-sore on the road. I suspect my position is more fixed so I don't move around on the saddle. Off-road, I'm shifting about a bit. And concentrating more on the trail than on my behind!</p>

<p>I started off off-road, on a lovely rail trail, and was happy to be there! There was some rain, as there has been most days, but nothing of consequence.</p>

<Img

  alt="rail trail"

<p>Green fields on one side, plowed soid on the other. A couple of Sunday riders passed me. A tourer going the other way. As they mainly would be, if following the Ruta de la Plata. I'm going against the flow. Although the current is not very strong!</p>

<p>It looks like some heavy rain has cost a farmer some necessary cash here.</p>

  alt="rail trail"

<p>Then the rail trail ended, after about ten kilometres, I transferred to the N-630. A vehicle every few minutes. Wide shoulder. Not exciting but easier progress.
