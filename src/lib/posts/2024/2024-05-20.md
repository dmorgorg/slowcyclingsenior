<h5>Oviedo</h5>

<p>A bit sore from my recent tumbles, I didn't immediately jump out of bed and head for Gijon. My route started in Gijon, on the coast, but I was in Oviedo, 35 kilometres to the south. Getting the train to Gijon from Santander in one day had looked difficult so I'd decided to lodge in Oviedo, get a morning train to Gijon and ride back. This way I could ease back on to the bike, after nearly a month of sitting, with only a partially loaded bike.But, with aching bones and scraped legs, this wasn't going to happen right away.</p>

<p>So I did a bit of wandering about. Nothing too ambitious. Overcast and drizzly, none too warm, and subject to occasional downpours.</p>

<p>The first Camino started from Oviedo, when King Alfonso II of Asturias (known as The Chaste) made the pilgrimage in 813. This was the Primitivo, nowadays reckoned to be one of the hardest walks. When the capital of the region was moved to L&eacute;on, the Camino Franc&eacute;s became more popular since it was less demanding.</p>
