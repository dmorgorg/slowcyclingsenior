  	13th March, 2024.<br/>
  	Nugegoda - Negombo
</h5>

<p>I was on the road before nine and through the city by ten. It could have been worse. No excessive or badly behaved traffic, alongside waterways frequently, or narrow lanes through poorer parts of the city. Then I crossed a larger river exiting into the ocean and was free of Colombo. For a while.</p>

<p>This didn't mean that I was immediately into pristine countryside. Fishing is the business here, boats trundling up and down a canal that was parallel to the nearby ocean, stalls along the canal, chopping up and selling freshly caught fish. There were three large pelicans patiently bobbing in the canal by one. Plenty of egrets, too, waiting for scraps.</p>
