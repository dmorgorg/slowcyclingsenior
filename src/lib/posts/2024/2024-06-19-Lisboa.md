  <p>Looks a pretty easy day. On paper. Not so, in fact.</p>

  <p>A good breakfast stop on the way out of town, a serendipitous move. My energy levels were low and I had been awake for quite a while in the night.</p>

    alt="trail view"

  <p>An off-road section, up through a forest or pine and eucalyptus, was quite steep. I got off to take a photograph, and then continued to push.</p>

  <p>It levelled out but not for long. Soon another climb, this one up loose, rutted gravel. My feet were sliding on the gravel, I would push the bike forward about a foot, lock the brakes, and try to catch up with my feet. For some reason, I thought of an infamous section on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR). Reputedly much worse, scree the size of the heads of small children. Not a lot of compensation really, in the moment. My arms were tired from pushing upward a foot at a time; it felt like a gym workout. But another 50-60 m climb done.</p>

  <p>Another one. My mind was a blur and I have no clear recollection. </p>

  <p>Then, thankfully, back onto pavement. Lunch in a friendly little pasteleria. 
   Chatted with a peregrino, an unemployed nuclear engineer whose company had got him out of Russia after they invaded Ukraine. The Russian, and his wife, had been located in various places &ndash; Turkey, Georgia, Romania, ... &ndash; before landing in Bulgaria. He still couldn't get work being considered a security risk.
   </p>

   <p>I arrived in Tomar at around 3:00 pm. Four hours for 30 km. It didn't seem a good idea to plod on &ndash; the next stage was longer and had twice as much climbing. </p>
