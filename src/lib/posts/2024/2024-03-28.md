<h5>
  	23rd March, 2024.
  	Point Pedro - Killinochi<br/>
    (61.9 km, 132 m, 1504.3 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Breakfast in a bakery and then on the already hot road. The heat definitely feels more oppressive these days. But it might be that I'm getting tired of it. Maybe even a little tired of being on the bike, too. Too maany uninteresting roads in the north; I'm missing those deserted roads through the countryside. And the novelty of Sri Lanka is starting to wear off.</p>

<p>I passed a local on a bike and he sped up to chat for a while. It always feels special when this occurs. He was an older gentleman (though not relative to me!) and surprised me with a little English. When I commiserated about the Sri Lankan economy and mentioned "Government bad?" he agreed. "Canada government bad. Same" I said. "Same!" and he laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>The morning was on a quiet B-road. Mainly short-haul farm workers on their creaking single-speeds. Or school-children in immaculate white shirts, but still on creaking bikes. Bikes are everywhere, it seems that everyone uses one, but they seemed shocked that they might be used for the longer distances that I'm using mine for.</p>

<p>I saw a number of rooves (roofs seems to be the American spelling so, on principle&mldr;)painted this way, reminders of the not so distant war. The paintwork is fairly well preserved, considering the war has been over for twenty years. I also saw more evidence of de-mining work. A sign with Sri Lanka and US flag on it. And a side road that seemed to be marked along both sides with half metre high stakes. A reminder to not wander too far off the beaten track...</p>

<p>And then back at Elephant Pass. I had passed 'combined' (army and police) checkpoints earlier in the day, and now again at the Pass, very important for the role it played in the war.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to miss the site of the terrorist bulldozer and the memorial monument showing four hands holding up the island of Sri Lanka. I must have been riding with my head down. Maybe it was the section where I was counting down from one thousand in decrements of seven.

<p>Low energy, slow moving, so it promised to be a very long day to Vavauniya. Main road, uninspiring landscape. Then a hotel hove into sight. Jaffna Gateway. Rooms. Say no more.</p>

<p>I have noticed that some town signs have exagerated elevations. By as much a 200 m. My phone GPS and my cycle computer correlate reasonably well (within 5%) but signs can be out by an improbable amount.</p>
