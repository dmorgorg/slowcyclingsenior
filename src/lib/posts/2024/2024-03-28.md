<h5>
  	17th March, 2024.
  	Point Pedro - Killinochi<br/>
    (61.9 km, 132 m, 1504.3 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Breakfast in a bakery and then on the already hot road. The heat definitely feels more oppressive these days. But it might be that I'm getting tired of it. Maybe even a little tired of being on the bike, too. Too maany uninteresting roads in the north; I'm missing those deserted roads through the countryside. And the novelty of Sri Lanka is starting to wear off.</p>
