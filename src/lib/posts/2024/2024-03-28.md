<p>Breakfast in a bakery and then on the already hot road. The heat definitely feels more oppressive these days. But it might be that I'm getting tired of it. Maybe even a little tired of being on the bike, too. Too maany uninteresting roads in the north; I'm missing those deserted roads through the countryside. And the novelty of Sri Lanka is starting to wear off.</p>

<p>I passed a local on a bike and he sped up to chat for a while. It always feels special when this occurs. He was an older gentleman (though not relative to me!) and surprised me with a little English. When I commiserated about the Sri Lankan economy and mentioned "Government bad?" he agreed. "Canada government bad. Same" I said. "Same!" and he laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>The morning was on a quiet B-road. Mainly short-haul farm workers on their creaking single-speeds. Or school-children in immaculate white shirts, but still on creaking bikes. Bikes are everywhere, it seems that everyone uses one, but they seemed shocked that they might be used for the longer distances that I'm using mine for.</p>
