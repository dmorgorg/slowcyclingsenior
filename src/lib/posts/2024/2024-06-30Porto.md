      25th June, 2024.
      Albergaria da Nova - Porto<br/>
      (58.2 km, 1051 m, 4103 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>After a day's rest, my legs had, to start at least, a little extra energy. Just as well, because it was a bit of an uninspiring day.</p>

  <p>It was overcast, misty and a fine drizzle (typical mizzle weather) and most of the day was through steep villages and busy towns, all built up with next to no exposure to open country. Some altitude gained to start, with clouds drifting over the tops of the houses. It was chilly, too. I wore my rain jacket for warmth as much as to keep out the damp. Then, inevitably, I would overheat clammily on the climbs. </p>

  <p>The path crossed a section of railway line that looked to be only a metre wide. And a railcrew working on the line. I had to unload my panniers to get the bike across piles of fresh gravel on either side of the track. It looked as though a once abandoned line was being recommissioned. Maybe the one I had ridden along briefly earlier.</p>

  <p>But I combined three peregrino stages although I wasn't exactly sure where the second ended and the third began. Just on a nondescript section of cobbled road, my route ended on the Wahoo. And the next stage started. Maybe whoever was recording the route on their gps mistakenly hit stop or end?</p>

  <p>The stage had a section of rocky path uphill through woods. The rocks were large, unlikely to have been laid recently: could this be an old Roman road? (I'll have to research. Later!) The slope was not so steep that I could not have ridden it (or at least most of it) if it had been more uniform cobbles but this was definitely a slow, upward stroll pushing the bike. Six o'clock and still some way to go but there were no alternatives.</p>

  <p>Then it levelled out, into sand. Some puddles. One deceptive.</p>

  <p>It was deeper than I had anticipated. And softer. My wheels sank lower and lower; I pedalled harder but came to a halt. I put down my left foot, but that too sank into the sand. I managed to get off without dropping the bike, now pretty much axle deep, which would have been disastrous for my camera. It was a strenuous push, up and out on to relatively solid and dry ground. I was a bit of a mess, mucky legs and sandals, and the bike wasn't much better. Would a hotel even want me in this condition?</p>

  <p>The next puddle looked worse, more of a lake, black and oily. But there was an alternative trail off to the side and I could skirt the danger.</p>

  <p>A couple out walking dogs in the woods warned of more water hazards ahead and recommended a different route. I was examining which way to go at a junction, they got going again. But not very far, a large (possibly Roman) rock topple me and over I went. I had a slow-motion vision of a different rock approaching my face as I neared the ground but I somehow managed to steer my body to the side without damaging my face or the wrist of my steering hand. I lay there face down, catching my breath and making sure everything was still working. A minor knee scrape, nothing worrying. I got up and wobbled on. My friendly dog-walker caught up with me. He had seen the fall and wanted to make sure I was alright. Then he accompanied me to his suggested route down a narrow path to a road and all adventure for the day was over.</p>

  <p>Wary of being turned away with my bike, an occasional occurrence in cities with a lack of space, I didn't book ahead but arrived at the Hotel Paulista late in the day. Yes, they had a room (booking.com had said three) and would take the bike. For &euro;10 per night! This is the first time I have been charged to store the bike but there was a sign with parking costs, including bicycles, on the reception desk. I unloaded my panniers from the bike, got my valuables from the handlebar bag, then wheeled the lightened bike to a nearby hotel with a garage. Without the bike for support, my ankle was very painful on the walk back to the Paulista &ndash; definitely a setback over the last few days.</p>

  <p>I took the tiny elevator (two people at most!) up to my unexciting room. Not only was this one of the, if not the, most expensive rooms on my trip &ndash; including a deal on a five-star hotel. But this room was not five star. By any means. But it had a couple of single beds and a shower. The shower was most welcome, first for cleaning the dirt of my sandals, then the dirt off my feet and legs, and finally to freshen up the rest of me. </p>

  <p>Then I dragged myself off in search of dinner, and a tv screen to watch another lacklustre performance by England in the Euros.</p>
