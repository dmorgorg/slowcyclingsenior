      25th June, 2024.
      Albergaria a Nova &ndash; Porto<br/>
      (58.2 km, 1051 m, 4103 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>After a day's rest, my legs had &ndash; to start at least &ndash; a little extra energy. Just as well, because it was a largely uninspiring day.</p>

  <p>It was overcast, misty with a fine drizzle (typical mizzle weather. Most of the day was through steep villages and busy towns, all built up with next to no exposure to open countryside. Some altitude gained to start, with clouds drifting over the tops of the houses. It was chilly, too. I wore my rain jacket for warmth as much as to keep out the damp. Then, inevitably, I would overheat clammily on the climbs. </p>

</div>

<p>A short section of 'single track' alongside an abandoned (?) railway line.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/06/2024-06-25-110120.jpg"
  alt="a rail trail"
  caption="A brief but pleasant path alongside abandoned tracks"
/>

<p>Then uphill and down, unnecessary perhaps because I ended up at (probably) the same railway line.</p>

  <p>The path crossed a section of railway line that looked to be only a metre wide. And a railcrew working on the line. I had to unload my panniers to get the bike across piles of fresh gravel on either side of the track. It looked as though a once abandoned line was being recommissioned. (Maybe the one I had ridden along briefly earlier?)</p>

  <p>I combined three peregrino stages although I wasn't exactly sure where the second ended and the third began. Just on a nondescript section of cobbled road, my route ended on the Wahoo. And the next stage started. Maybe whoever was recording the route on their gps mistakenly hit stop or end?</p>

  <p>Then the final (second or third?) stage had a section of rocky path uphill through woods. The rocks were large, unlikely to have been laid recently: could this be an old Roman road? (I'll have to research. Later!) The slope was not so steep that I could not have ridden it (or at least most of it) if it had been more uniform cobbles but this was definitely a slow, upward stroll pushing the bike. Six o'clock and still some way to go but there were no alternatives.</p>

/>

  <p>Then it levelled out, into sand. Some puddles. One deceptive. Significantly.</p>

  <p>It was deeper than I had anticipated. And softer. My wheels sank lower and lower; I pedalled harder but came to a halt. I put down my left foot, but that too sank into the soft sand. I managed to dismount without dropping the bike which was now pretty much axle deep; dropping would have been disastrous for my camera. Then a strenuous push, up and out on to relatively solid and dry ground. I was a bit of a mess, mucky legs and sandals, and the bike was worse. Would a hotel even want me in this condition?</p>

  <p>The next puddle looked evil, more of a lake, black and oily. But there was an alternative trail off to the side and I could skirt the danger.</p>

  <p>A couple, out walking their dogs in the woods, warned of more water hazards ahead and recommended a different route. I was examining which way to go at a junction, then got going again. But not very far, a large (possibly Roman) rock unsettled me, and over I went. I had a slow-motion vision of a large unyielding rock approaching my face as I neared the ground but I somehow managed to steer my body aside without damaging my face or the wrist of my steering hand. I lay there face down for a while, catching my breath and making sure everything was still working. A minor knee scrape, nothing worrying. I got up and started to pedal on. One friendly dog-walker caught up with me. He had seen the fall and wanted to make sure I was alright. Then he accompanied me to his suggested altenative route, down a narrow path between tall bushes, to a road. Ann all adventure for the day was over.</p>

  <p>Entrance to Porto was over a bridge, high (very high) over the River Douro. Spectacular!</p>

  <p>Wary of being turned away with my bike, an occasional occurrence in cities with a lack of space, I hadn't booked ahead but arrived at the Hotel Paulista late in the day. Yes, they had a room (booking.com had said they had three) and would take the bike. For &euro;10 per night! This is the first time I have been charged to store the bike but there was a sign with parking costs, including bicycles, on the reception counter. I unloaded my panniers, got my valuables from the handlebar bag, and wheeled the now lightened bike to a nearby hotel with a garage. Without the bike for support, my ankle was very painful on the walk back to the Paulista &ndash; my ankle has definitely suffered a setback over the last few days.</p>

  <p>I took the tiny elevator (two very friendly people at most!) up to my unexciting room. This one of the, if not the, most expensive rooms on my trip &ndash; including a deal on a five-star hotel. But this room was not five star. By any means. Two narrow single beds. But it had a shower, which was most welcome, first for cleaning the dirt off my sandals, then the dirt off my feet and legs, and finally to freshen up the rest of me. </p>

  <p>Then I dragged myself off in search of dinner, and a tv screen to watch another lacklustre performance by England in the Euros.</p>

  <h5>Porto and Gaia</h5>

  <p>A day sight-seeing. My ankle is paining me so I bought a ticket for one of the hop-on hop-off bus tours. The first one (the red-line) took me around Porto a little, then out to the beach and back along the coast. Then I went to the cathedral, got a stamp in my camino passport (somewhat cursorily delivered by the young man selling tickets), and spent some time in the cathedral cloisters, up the tower, then into the cathedral proper. It was perhaps to least grandiose of all the cathedrals I've visited but the cloisters, with their extensive painted tile work, was quite nice.</p>

  <p>Except for one 'tourist.' A man, around thirty, was dancing in a mocking fashion in the centre of the cloister courtyard, then went to leave, turned around and spat. Drugged, drunk or simply a jerk &ndash; or all three?</p>

  <p>I walked over the bridge &ndash; the Ponte Luis I &ndash; that I'd entered the city by on the previous evening, enjoying the views down to the River Douro a long (very long) way below. The bridge was just a walkway with a couple of tram tracks down the centre. And very crowded with tourists. As is Porto. </p>

  <p>On the south side of the river is Gaia. Then on another bus (the blue-line this time) for a ride back towards the hotel.</p>

  alt="Ponte Luis I"

  <p>I was out of sorts. I'd woken from bad dreams and never managed to shake off my negativity. I'm also disappointed in the setback to my ankle having hoped to have strengthened it sufficiently over the last few months so that it wouldn't bother me again. And a somewhat shabby room in an underwhelming although expensive hotel, in a tourist city, didn't help. </p>

  <p>Dinner, in front of a tv, showing Portugal lose. Christian Ronaldo looked out of sorts as well.</p>

      27th June, 2024.
      Porto &ndash; Vilarinho<br/>
      (28.5 km, 320 m, 4132.2 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>It felt good to be back on the road again, and to be leaving Porto. It was steady climbing for a while but never too steep. Cobbles seemingly without end. Built up and heavily trafficked for the first fifteen or more kilometres.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/06/2024-06-27-140236.jpg"

   <p>Then some countryside, but I still felt separate from it, along country cobbled lanes frequently between high walls. </p>

  <p>A short day. There will be more like it coming up. I don't really want to arrive in Santiage before earlyish on the 4th, in time for my bus on the 5th. And it's only 214 km, with six and a bit days to do it in.</p>

  <p>I'm in a six-bedroom dorm, in a small albergue, so I hope I don't sleep too noisily. There is a very pleasant garden to relax in.</p>

      Vilarinho &ndash; Via Boa<br/>
      (31.5 km, 473 m, 4163.7 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>A very good night's sleep. In bed at 9:00 pm, before either of my roomies. The Argentinian lady was up early, before light, and off to a good start. The German young man was slower than I was.</p>

  <p>I had a small breakfast at the restaurant a few yards from the albergue and watch a few peregrinos walk past. Then it was my turn to make progress towards the north with legs that felt more tired than I expected. A grey, overcast day but no precipitation, no wind and little heat.</p>

  <p>Trending downhill to start, down to an old Roman bridge over a river. Which inevitably necessitated considerable climbing on the other side. </p>

  <p>Better scenery today, a more rural feeling to the surroundings. Cobbles again. Cobbles count as 'pavement' but is more energy sapping than some of the dirt. </p>

<p>The dirt, when it appeared, was a nice change.</p>

  <p>I caught up with a unicyclist. From behind, I assumed a young man. When he stopped at the top of a hill and turned around, I saw a bushy white beard. Not a young man, just young in spirit. From Slovakia, doing Porto to Santiago. We played leapfrog for a while: he was faster on the uphill and I was on the flat and downhill. </p>

  <p>I'm now within 200 km of Santiago. I need at least two stamps a day in my camino passport to get a certificate/credential upon completion in Santiago. </p>

<p>Most peregrinos end their day in Barcelos. This cyclist decided to go on a few more kilometres to a nice-sounding rest stop in Vila Boa. Possibly a mistake. Although cheap, and hosted by very sweet people, it is lacking in atmosphere. White tiles, white walls. A garden paved with indoor/outdoor green imitation lawn. A bunk bed in a tiny room. An insubstantial meal. Maybe I'm getting too picky?</p>
