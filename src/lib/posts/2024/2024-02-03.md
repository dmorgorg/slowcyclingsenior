<h5>
  	29th January, 2024
  	<br />Talpe to Dickwella
</h5>
(58.8 km, 271 m, 210.1 km to date)

<p>Quickly down to the A2 and a left turn, eastward along the south coast. The road hugged the coast pretty tightly and there were frequent glimpses of the sea. Plenty of Western tourists and lots of surfboards in evidence. Steady traffic but not threatening. </p>

<h5>
  	1st February, 2024
  	<br />Thanamalwila to Buttala
</h5>
(48.4 km, 320 m, 354.0 km to date)
<p>An underwhelming night in the underwhelming room. But it worked. Breakfast was again, probably due to miscommunication, was huge. And expensive. My room was 3500/- which didn't seem to gel with what I had anticipated and the meals were 3000/- each. The booking.com rating of 3.8 may not have been far off the mark. But, to be fair, the chicken curry was tasty and the curd excellent.</p>
<p>I rode without padded shorts but it wasn't an unqualified success. Back to the cushioning for a while! An unexciting but not bad 20 km on the highway passed soon enough but my legs were tired. I had adjusted my rear brake the previous morning and may have overdone it; it felt like it was dragging a bit. Or was it just my tired legs? I pulled into the shade of some trees, inhaled some water, and readjusted the brake. It might have been psychological but it did seem easier to pedal after that.</p>
<p>At Thelulla, I left the smooth tarmac up a steep concrete incline and on to quiet country lanes and dirt trails again. Magical. I wasn't the only cyclist.</p>

<p>When I wasn't meandering through the dirt, there were narrow, impeccable tarmacked road with the occasional passing motor-bike or tuktuk. And the very occasional car. Pleasant and soothing; this is what touring is about. Ambling through this countryside, it's hard to feel the tiredness in one's legs. Although it is easy to still feel the power of the sun.</p>

<p>I was unsure what was growing here. Until I passed a huge sugar mill. This must be (is?) sugarcane. The mill employs about 4000 in the plant and about 300,000 sugarcane farmers.</p>

<p>The weather forecast promised rain (with a 100% probability) and a downfall of 66 mm. Not a trivial amount. The app (Weather Underground) told me it was already raining. Maybe it was at the nearest station but I escaped unscathed and pulled into the hotel in the middle of the afternoon after another splendid day. Sore bum notwithstanding.</p>
