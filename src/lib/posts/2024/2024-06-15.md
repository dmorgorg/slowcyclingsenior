      10th June, 2024.
      Tavira - Quarteira<br/>
      (67.7 km, 506 m, 3342 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>I had a leisurely breakfast. The 'youth' hostel client&egrave;le seemed mainly middle-aged; maybe it was still too early for the youngsters. And some &ndash; closer to thirty than their teens &ndash; did trickle in later. Mainly female. And mainly quite heavy. I was surprised at the number of large, sometimes huge, legs and butts. On casual display. Excess flesh, in short clothing, at eye-level as I ate my breakfast &ndash; it was somewhat off-putting. Relatively speaking, obese that I presumably still am, I wasn't too bad. But it was a low bar I was comparing myself to.</p>

  <p>I went to reception to book for a second night; my tired legs seemed to be sending me a warning about another day in the saddle without some recuperation. But I was SOL, as we used to say. No lower bunks available. And me clambering up and down in the night on my numerous (well, two or three) trips to the bathroom would not have been much fun for the person sleeping below me. It looks like I'm on the road again...</p>

  <p>In expectation of a second day here, my electronics were not recharged. So I hooked my Wahoo into my power back. I shouldn't need too much. </p>

  <p>A young man had arrived sometime in the night, judging by the mop of hair I could see above the edge of the upper bunk opposite. The elderly man on the lower bunk didn't seem to be moving much. We'd exchanged a friendly thumbs-up when I'd got up for breakfast but now he was back in the bunk. Under the heavier covers that were available although the room was very warm.  He also was wearing a woolly sweater, a cap and gloves! An occasional light snore reassured me that he was, indeed, still alive.</p>

  <p>I mentioned the old gent when I was checking out at reception and she was going to look in and make sure he was fine. Then I was out of the garage and heading west again. Slow to start, as my legs warmed up, and slow to continue for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>There was a westerly breeze that grew stronger as the day progressed. My weather app forecast 18 mph with gusts of 30 mph. I was riding right into it most of the time. I found my self on a posted cycle route, along the south coast. Quarteira, my perhaps optimistic destination for the day, didn't warrant a mention.</p>

   <p>And there was the occasional reminder that I was also on Eurovelo 1, The Atlantic Coast Route. As Iwould be, on and off, for the next two or three weeks.</p>

   <p>Slow plodding. Hard pedaling into the wind, especially when I was right along the coast. At one point, my cycle.travel route had me going straight when the EV1 sign said left. I turned left. After a kilometre, there was the sudden end of a boardwalk and a bar across the path. I could see what looked like a continuation in about three hundred metres so I tilted the bike under the bar, off the boardwalk and half a metre down to sand. There were a number of bike tyres tracks so I presumed things were still good. Sandy tracks alongside fields led to a little bridge - a six-by-six post. I wheeled across, up a sandy bank, through a hole in a fence, and onto a section of double track. Which did, eventually, rejoin my cycle.travel route. All part of the 'fun' I suppose but it was a low energy day for me and I could well do without these extra challenges.</p>

   <p>Busy A-roads into Olh&atilde;o, with a shoulder but nothing much to look at. I stopped at a Lidl (foregoing the Aldi I'd seen a couple of kilometres earlier) for some pizza-flavoured crumbly rolls and some orange juice. I ate in the shade of Lidl, on a window ledge, under the watchful gaze of security. Maybe I looked homeless?</p>

  <p>Then some fun graffiti!</p>

<p>More traffic into Faro. I had always anticipated staying in Faro but accommodation was sparse or expensive and the dormitory in Quarteira beckoned.</p>

<p>Portugal had felt different almost from the start. Here I began to notice it more. Lots of golf courses, either complete or planned. And numerous sales offices, with signs in English, hoping to separate retirees from some of their accumulated cash. It didn't appeal that much, not to me. More Mercedes and BMWs. </p>

<p>Looking into the windows of realtors or sales offices, prices seemed to be five or six times the prices I'd seen in Spain. Roughly. To face onto bright green fairways, I presumed. And not have to learn the language. </p>

  <p>The hills seemed harder as, late in the day, I arrived in Quarteira. The dorm was very comfortable. The cod kebab and shrimp just across from the dorm was excellent. I slept very well.</p>

<p>A rest day. I feel like it's necessary. Hanging out in the 'hotel,' catching up on my blog</p>
