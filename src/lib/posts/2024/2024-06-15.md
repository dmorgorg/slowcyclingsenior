      Tavira - Quarteira<br/>
      (67.7 km, 506 m, 3342 km to date)
  </h5>

  <p>I had a leisurely breakfast. The 'youth' hostel client&egrave;le seemed mainly middle-aged; maybe it was still too early for the youngsters. And some &ndash; closer to thirty than their teens &ndash; did trickle in later. Mainly female. And mainly quite heavy. I was surprised at the number of large, sometimes huge, legs and butts. On casual display. Excess flesh, in short clothing, at eye-level as I ate my breakfast &ndash; it was somewhat off-putting. Relatively speaking, obese that I presumably still am, I wasn't too bad. But it was a low bar I was comparing myself to.</p>

  <p>I went to reception to book for a second night; my tired legs seemed to be sending me a warning about another day in the saddle without some recuperation. But I was SOL, as we used to say. No lower bunks available. And me clambering up and down in the night on my numerous (well, two or three) trips to the bathroom would not have been much fun for the person sleeping below me. It looks like I'm on the road again...</p>

  <p>In expectation of a second day here, my electronics were not recharged. So I hooked my Wahoo into my power back. I shouldn't need too much. </p>

  <p>A young man had arrived sometime in the night, judging by the mop of hair I could see above the edge of the upper bunk opposite. The elderly man on the lower bunk didn't seem to be moving much. We'd exchanged a friendly thumbs-up when I'd got up for breakfast but now he was back in the bunk. Under the heavier covers that were available although the room was very warm.  He also was wearing a woolly sweater, a cap and gloves! An occasional light snore reassured me that he was, indeed, still alive.</p>

<p>A rest day. I feel like it's necessary. Hanging out in the 'hotel,' catching up on my blog</p>
