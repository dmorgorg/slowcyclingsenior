<p>I walked into Lewisham one day, for a haircut. The walk wasn't intentional but, in haste, I'd jumped on to the bus going the Packham, not the one to Catford! I realised my mistake and 'alighted' at Deptford Bridge and walked into Lewisham from their. The path, parallel to a dirty trickle of water called &ndash; somewhat grandiosely, in my opinion &ndash; the River Ravensbourne. Ravensbourne Park, heavily vegetated, provides surprising habitat for birdlife amidst the very urban south-east London borough of Lewisham. It seemed unlikely that there was much in the way of sustenance for this heron but it seemed quite content. And unconcerned about my nosiness.</p>

<p>You are never far from the prying eyes of CCTV in the UK. The camera blends in well with the artwork beside an entrance to Lewisham Shopping Centre. Big Brother is everywhere.</p>

<p>On my ride up to Waterloo station to catch a train to Portsmouth and the ferry to Santander, Spain, I called in at UK Cycles. I needed a new bell. But they had none on display but the man behind the counter disappeared to the workshop and came back with a functional bell, which he quickly installed on my bike. No charge for the bell. Feeling strangely uplifted by this service, I continued up to town with a smile on my face.</p>

<p>Portsmouth was a shock. Cold and windy. Much more so than London had felt. But I was pretty much the first passenger on the boat and my cabin was comfortable. The outward ferry, Portsmouth to Santander, is two nights and one day of sailing. I had decided on the rather extravagant cabin option rather than sleeping in a reclining seat for two consecutive nights. Age has its privileges.</p>

<p>A civilized way to travel, compared to flying. Relaxed, football (soccer) matches on the TV. A smooth crossing &ndash; I would have been happier for some strenuous rolling of the ship but there were no waves of note and, what there were, were cancelled out by the ship's stabilizers. But you can't have everything.</p>

<p>We docked at 8:00 and we cyclists (there were three tandems and three single-occupancy bikes) were off the ship and through immigration quickly. In time to arrive at the station before the first train left for Oviedo. Except that when I rolled up onto the empty platform a couple of minutes early, the train rolled away. Part of me wondered whether the driver was having a bad day. Damn, seven and a half hours until the next train!</p>

<p>I tried the bus station, across a square from the train station. My bike would have to  be 'wrapped.' I queried 'wrapped' but the lady couldn't explain what that meant. Cardboard was mentioned. An American couple, presumably peregrinos, overheard my laboured discussion and mentioned that the post office would wrap the bike for me (they had just sent some stuff home, as many do once they have a few days carrying unnecessary weight on their backs, up and down hills) and were sure they would look after me. Maybe, but too much hassle to save a few hours. How would I get the incapacitated bike back to the bus station? A taxi, probably. I decided to read my book and wait for the 1536 train. And get on to the platform a little early!</p>

<p>Even now, this was not certain. The ticket office had sold me a ticket only as far as Llanes. Apparently, they didn't know whether the train would continue. The train did say Oviedo on it so... Once underway, a conductor checked my ticket (one for myself and one for the bike) and sold me a couple more for Llanes to Oviedo. Looking good!</p>

<p>A gentle rattle through pretty green hills, occasionally with fleeting but spectacular coastal views. A train change at Llanes. On again, more inland now, lots of stops, people getting on and off for journeys of a few minutes. Through a place called Poo, reminding me of a identically named town in the Himachal Pradesh of northern India. In HP, there had supposed to be a much photographed signpost, "Turn left to Poo," but I hadn't seen it on my ride past. Maybe the local bigwigs had thought it embarrassing? I managed to get a quick phone picture of this train staion sign. Schoolboy humour? Guilty as charged.

<p>The first Camino started from Oviedo, when King Alfonso II of Asturias (known as The Chaste) made the pilgrimage in 813. This was the Primitivo, nowadays reckoned to be one of the hardest walks. When the capital of the region was moved to L&eacute;on, the Camino Franc&eacute;s became more popular since it was less demanding.</p>
