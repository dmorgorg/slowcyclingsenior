<p>Bev was in need of a sunset so we went to a reputedly good spot: Jaffna Fort. They were very happy to take our entrance money. But Bev thought to aske what time they closed. They closed in nine minutes time, at six pm. We declined.</p>

  	A voyage to Delft Island
</h5>
<p>An early breakfast, and Leel picked us up at 7:00 am for the 45 minute drive to the ferry to Delft Island. It started as a pleasant drive but it became increasingly obvious we wouldn't be on time for the ferry. Sections of the road were rough, still metalled but heavily patched or, equally frustrating, rutted, on causeways between the islands we had to traverse to reach the ferry. Leel drove very cautiously for long sections, not much faster than walking pace. Oh well, I hadn't been fully invested in this day trip anyway. </p>
<p>Leel frequently pulled over to let buses and cars pass. One one occasion, we were passed by a motorcycle, towing another motorcycle with a narrow rope between them, the rope attached to the lead vehicles seat and wrapped around the hand of the towee! They soon disappeared into the distance.</p>

    alt="our ferry"

<div class="caption">Our 'ferry' to Delft.</div>
<p>According to our information, we had to be at the  Kurikadduwan terminus by 8:00, in order to get a seat on the ferry that left between 8:30 and 9:00. It was close to 9:00 when we arrived. There were crowds everywhere, mainly women, walking along a long jetty to where some boats were waiting. Information was sparse but, somehow, we found ourselves on a boat, It looked more like a private charter than a government boat but we were crowded on.</p>

<div class="caption">Our boat felt almost seaworthy compared with some of the competition.</div>
<p>At an island, our boat docked for half-an-hour so that the passengers could visit a temple. Today was Poyaday, which is a holiday (despite the actual full moon not being until after midnight) which explained the crowds and restrained festive atmosphere. And the predominantly female proportion of passengers, since their mensfolk were presumably at work.</p>
<p>Then we headed out to sea and a faint shadow indicated an island on the horizon. I did think about occasional news stories we hear about overcrowded ferries capsizing, causing many deaths, and I kept a cautious weather-eye on the sky. Cloudless, so we were probably OK... I moved to the foredeck for space, breeze and air. It seemed that the people there were from the same village; I was pretty sure this was not the (cheap) ferry we had been planning on.</p>
<p>Leel arranged a tuktuk for a tour of the island (for 10,000 LKR, showing appreciable inflation since the 3,000 I had read about &ndash; admittedly before Covid) and off we set.</p>
<p>Delft Island is largely composed of coral and limestone. Walls are frequently constructed out of coral.</p>

<p>The island was first occupied by the Dutch, and they used pigeons for communication between Delft and Jaffna. The pigeon nest is in the grounds of the old Dutch Hospital. During the British occupation, the court and jailhouse was in the same grounds.</p>

<div class="caption">Wild horses</div>

<p>The island was once known as  <em>Ilha das Cavallos</em>, or <em>Island of Horses</em>. A herd of around 600 wild horses remains on the island.  (I presume from the time of the Portuguese colonisation, prior to the Dutch, since <em>Ilha das Cavallos</em> is Portuguese.) Although known as 'wild,' this is not exact since they are descended from domesticated islands: maybe feral is a more apt description?</p>

<p>The trees with circular foliage at their tops are Palmyra palm, important in the local economy. (It is also used for a type of fence that we saw elsewhere on the peninsula.)</p>

<p>The Baobob tree is not indigenous to Sri Lanka but this one may have been brought by the Portuguese since they used it for curing diseases in the horses. Or it may have been brought by Arabs earlier which would help explain its large size.</p>

<p>The cost for crashing this private boat party was not inconsiderable, although I don't know if the boat captain charged a tourist rate. 12,000 LKR (Canadian $52.00). So the day's jaunt cost much more than initially anticipated, one of the drawbacks of having a driver who thinks all Westerners are made of money. In fairness, compared to the locals, we certainly are. Just to be able to finance a cheap three month holiday is beyond comprehension for many. </p>
<p>And the drive back to Jaffna, a couple more Hindu temples:</p>
