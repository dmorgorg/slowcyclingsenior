  	Sevilla. 5th June, 2024
</h5>

<p>A day spent wandering around, investigating some of the many sights.</p>

<h6>The streets of Sevilla...</h6>

<p>I could hear the tyres of this SUV, too big for these streets, squeaking on each side against the curbs.</p>

<h6>Church of the Savior (Iglesia Colegial del Divino Salvador)</h6>

<p>Converted from a mosque in the 13th century, and rebuilt in the 17th. A 'masterpiece' of baroque architecture, with 'intricate carvings, gilded details and ornate sculptures.'</p>

<p>A short day was planned. I'd just make up the final 38 km to Lep&eacute; that I hadn't managed the day before. That was the plan...</p>

<p>First, I rode up to the Dia supermarket. The sign said that it was open from nine in the morning until nine in the evening, six days a week. I had allowed for the possibility of it being clased on Saturday afternoon, but that didn't seem to be a problem. I rode away, without any purchases; I didn't need to carry it all day if I could restock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>It was an easy morning, having the roads pretty much to myself.</p>

<p>A dedicated cycle path brought me into Gibral&eacute;on. I shared it with some dog walkers, and older (though not older than me) male mountain bikers. The trail was well-used. The trail continued, even advertising Eurovelo 1 at the bottome of a few kilometer markers.</p>

  <p>Some cactus, growing along the side of the trail, reminded me of Mexico</p>
