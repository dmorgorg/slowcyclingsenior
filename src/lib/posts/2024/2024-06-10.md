      4th June, 2024.
      Almad&eacute;n de la Plata - Sevilla<br/>
      (68.9 km, 464 m, 3057.2 km to date)
  </h5>

<p>The hotel in Almaden called Casa Concha was very pleasant. I could have spent another night there but time is pressing... </p>

<p>I wheeled my bike down to the Bar Morales for breakfast at around 9:00 a.m. Maybe 9:30. The bar must have been early openly because they were already tables that need cleaning out in the suare. I doubt they have been left like that overnight. Breakfast was cafe con leche and tostada with tomato and olive oil. And of course a second coffee con leche before I set off. </p>

<p>A bit of a climb out of town was not very friendly to my tired legs, but I was soon on quiet country roads through very nice countryside. Still, there was more climbing than I thought necessary for what had been forecast as a primarily downhill day. By the time I had covered 12 km I climbed over 200 m. But then a long downhill and some fast speeds reached. So fast that my helmet slid off my head and was held in place by the straps wrapped around my throat. 67 kph might be a record for this trip so far.</p>

  alt="out of almaden"
/>

<p>Then, closer to Sevilla, I began to get caught up in faster moving vehicles on roads without much shoulder, quite an unpleasant change from what I had grown accustomed to. The route I had chosen was from cycle.travel and would take me directly to my hotel in Seville. When I checked the Ruta de la Plata map, I found that I was far to the east of it. </p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/06/2024-06-04-125549.jpg"
  alt="out of almaden"
/>

<p>With hindsight, it would have been better take the Ruta de la Plata route to the outskirts of Seville,  and then keyed my hotel into cycle.travel. Too late now. </p>

<p>And then I was in Sevilla, weaving in and out of narrow cobbled lanes, and at my perfectly located quaint old hotel by 3:00 pm. Perfectly located, indeed, but without a lift. I was on the second floor, but each floor seemed to have two long flights of stairs. My knees, which seem happy enough on the bike, do not want to bear my full weight when going upstairs.</p>

<p>The hotel was very well located a few minutes walk from the cathedral. It's definitely already high season; English voices are common. I popped into a tourist office (not an official one) and learned that it was very difficult to get into the cathedral. And for the palace it was almost hopeless. Tickets went on sale at 9:00 a.m. with people lining up from 7:00 am. Or so I was told. I guess I won't be seeing the palace. This stay in Sevilla was about resting my legs as much as seeing the sights and my hotel bed was very comfortable.</p>

<p>So I wandered around and took some photos,  enjoying the narrow streets. I wonder how anybody found their way around before Google maps? I booked a flamenco performance for 10:30 at night. It was an amazing, intimate setting, front row seat. Great talent. </p>

<p>Then out into the warm evening,  night really since it was almost midnight. But the bars were closing and I had a thirst: I found a cocktail bar and got a couple of bottles of beer, finally retiring to my hotel room about 1:30 in the morning. I had felt ina bit of a party mood having reached Sevilla, always an important destination of this ride, the end of the Via Ruta la Plata. Part 2 starts now.</p>

  	Sevilla. 5th June, 2024
</h5>

<p>A day spent wandering around, investigating some of the many sights.</p>

<p>Not the earliest of starts after my indulgences the previous night. The hotel breakfast was small but surprisingly good. Orange juice (local Sevilla oranges? It could be reconstituted Floridian concentrate for all I know). Then out to visit one of the churches that had I noticed the evening before.</p>

<h6>The streets of Sevilla...</h6>

<p>I could hear the tyres of this SUV, too big for these streets, squeaking on each side against the curbs.</p>

<h6>Church of the Saviour (Iglesia Colegial del Divino Salvador)</h6>

<p>Converted from a mosque in the 13th century, and rebuilt in the 17th. A 'masterpiece' of baroque architecture, with 'intricate carvings, gilded details and ornate sculptures.'</p>

<p>Lo and behold, my entrance ticket to the Church of the Saviour also  admitted me to the Cathedral. My informant the day before had been less than completely honest with me. Surprising the private tourist operator not giving me the full details! </p>

<p>A short day was planned. I'd just make up the final 38 km to Lep&eacute; that I hadn't managed the day before. That was the plan...</p>

<p>First, I rode up to the Dia supermarket. The sign said that it was open from nine in the morning until nine in the evening, six days a week. I had allowed for the possibility of it being clased on Saturday afternoon, but that didn't seem to be a problem. I rode away, without any purchases; I didn't need to carry it all day if I could restock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>It was an easy morning, having the roads pretty much to myself.</p>

    alt="Andalucia solar farm"

<p>A dedicated cycle path brought me into Gibral&eacute;on. I shared it with some dog walkers, and older (though not older than me) male mountain bikers. The trail was well-used. The trail continued, even advertising Eurovelo 1 at the bottome of a few kilometer markers.</p>

  <p>Some cactus, growing along the side of the trail, reminded me of Mexico</p>

<p>Speeding downhill, I must have missed a turning somewhere. Given that I was travelling between two banks of vegetation at the time, the turn cannot have been very prominent. I had no idea I had missed anything until I notice a notification on my Wahoo head unit, indicating an about turn. But I was still on a dedicated, and very nice, cycle path so I continued; they would join up again soon. I still had my doubts about the turn I should have taken &ndash; maybe it had overgrown, or had been discontinued?</p>

<p>I did, eventually, check my position on my mapping app. I was going to far south for my originally planned path. And my Wahoo was no longer updating my distance to go to Lep&eacute;. As though I was so far off route that it had given up?</p>

<p>All this, despite having tried to update the gpx file with a new one, calculated from my current location to Lep&eacute;. A phone reboot seemed to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>I had come too far south, and was now directed back north. The distance to Lep&eacute; was more than I wanted it to be. I had mistakenly added about 18 km to my 'easy, short' day!</p>

<p>I was directed into a recreational area where a couple of small family groups appeared to be picknicking. It was a lovely location, with nice trees. And gravel, interspersed with unwelcome stretches of soft, sandy double track that threatenend to toss me to the ground. But the track only threatened and I managed without too much harm to my ego. Wider tyres would have been helpful.</p>

<Img

<p>Then a steep incline to pavement again, alongside a canal. Vey varied riding today. And fun, if not quite the day I had anticipated. </p>

<p>But I arrived, more tired than I had expected, where I had planned. Later and longer but never mind... A day full of surprises.</p>

  <p>A bit of road and then I found the way down to a rail trail. Some sandy sections, requiring effort and concentration. </p>

<p>There is a bridge between Spain and Portugal. But not for cyclists. We get to take a little ferry, which is much better!</p>

<p>It's a short crossing, ten to fifteen minutes. About &euro;5 for the bike and for me. Mainly pedestrians on the small ferry but also a couple of cars.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/06/2024-06-09-131401.jpg"
  alt="ferry to portugal"

<p>And then, without fanfare, I was in Portugal. And sad to be leaving Spain. It feels like I'm making my way home now &ndash; even if I still have four weeks to get to the other ferry, the one from Santander to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>I stopped at a caf&eacute; for lunch. Portugues tripe stew, which was excellent. And anchovies in vinegar. Which were even better. Then, time to ride on and head to Tavira, a dorm and sleep.</p>
