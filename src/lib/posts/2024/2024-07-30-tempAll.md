  <p>A day sight-seeing. My ankle is paining me so I bought a ticket for one of the hop-on hop-off bus tours. The first one (the red-line) took me around Porto a little, then out to the beach and back along the coast. Then I went to the cathedral, got a stamp in my camino passport (somewhat cursorily delivered by the young man selling entrance tickets), and then spent some time in the cathedral cloisters, up the tower, then into the cathedral proper. It was perhaps the least grandiose of all the cathedrals I've visited on this trip so far but the cloisters, with their extensive painted tile work, was quite nice.</p>

  <p>Except for one 'tourist.' A man, around thirty, was dancing in a deliberately disrespectful fashion in the centre of the cloister courtyard, then went to leave, turned around and spat. Drugged, drunk or simply a jerk &ndash; or all three?</p>

  <h6>Cathedral Cloisters</h6>

  <p>I walked over the bridge &ndash; the Ponte Luis I &ndash; that I'd entered the city by on the previous evening, enjoying the views down to the River Douro a long (very long) way below. The bridge was just a walkway with a couple of tram tracks down the centre. And very crowded with tourists. As is Porto. </p>

<p>Perhaps an original, or more likely a replica, of boats used to transport port barrels, now repurposed for the tourist trade.</p>

  <p>On the south side of the river is Gaia. Then on another bus (the blue-line this time) for a ride back towards the hotel.</p>

  <p>I was out of sorts. I'd woken from bad dreams and never managed to shake off my negativity. I'm also disappointed in the setback to my ankle having hoped to have strengthened it sufficiently over the last few months so that it wouldn't bother me again. And a somewhat shabby room in an underwhelming although expensive hotel, in a tourist city, didn't help. </p>

  <p>It felt good to be back on the road again, and to be leaving Porto. It was steady climbing for a while but never too steep. Cobbles seemingly without end. Built up and heavily trafficked for the first fifteen or more kilometres.</p>

   <p>Then some countryside, but I still felt separate from it, along country cobbled lanes frequently between high walls. </p>

  <p>A short day. There will be more like it coming up. I don't really want to arrive in Santiage before earlyish on the 4th, in time for my bus on the 5th. And it's only 214 km, with six and a bit days to do it in.</p>

  <p>I'm in a six-bedroom dorm, in a small albergue, so I hope I don't sleep too noisily. There is a very pleasant garden to relax in.</p>

  <p>A very good night's sleep. In bed at 9:00 pm, before either of my roomies. The Argentinian lady was up early, before light, and off to a good start. The German young man was slower than I was.</p>

  <p>I had a small breakfast at the restaurant a few yards from the albergue and watch a few peregrinos walk past. Then it was my turn to make progress towards the north with legs that felt more tired than I expected. A grey, overcast day but no precipitation, no wind and little heat.</p>

  <p>Trending downhill to start, down to an old Roman bridge over a river. Which inevitably necessitated considerable climbing on the other side. </p>

  <p>Better scenery today, a more rural feeling to the surroundings. Cobbles again. Cobbles count as 'pavement' but is more energy sapping than some of the dirt. </p>

<p>The dirt, when it appeared, was a nice change.</p>

  <p>I caught up with a unicyclist. From behind, I assumed a young man. When he stopped at the top of a hill and turned around, I saw a bushy white beard. Not a young man, just young in spirit. From Slovakia, doing Porto to Santiago. We played leapfrog for a while: he was faster on the uphill and I was on the flat and downhill. </p>

  <p>I'm now within 200 km of Santiago. I need at least two stamps a day in my camino passport to get a certificate/credential upon completion in Santiago. </p>

<p>Most peregrinos end their day in Barcelos. This cyclist decided to go on a few more kilometres to a nice-sounding rest stop in Vila Boa. Possibly a mistake. Although cheap, and hosted by very sweet people, it is lacking in atmosphere. White tiles, white walls. A garden paved with indoor/outdoor green imitation lawn. A bunk bed in a tiny room. An insubstantial meal. Maybe I'm getting too picky?</p>
