<h5>
  	1st April, 2024.
  	Trincomalee - Varakai<br/>
    (89.0 km, 256 m, 1774.3 km to date)
</h5>

<p>At breakfast, before setting off, Silva &ndash; the chef &ndash; complained of the heat. And it did feel hotter, more oppressive but I put this down to me just being tired of it. I wasn't hugely excited about getting back on the bike for a day in the sun.</p>

<p>I noticed my back tyre a bit soft so I stopped to add some air. A local insisted on helping, adding about twenty strokes to my previous forty. Then I was heading for town, Trincomalee, and a bank. I was pretty much cleaned out for cash.</p>

<p>The first ATM was not functioning so I carried on and found another. Then, Komoot's rerouting had me on steep, sandy back lanes. Not great, so I retreated to the tarmac and retraced my route, having seen little of Trinco, and found the A15 that would take me south.</p>

<p>The riding was tough, hot. But that was me rather than the road. I stopped to eat a snack (two chicken buns that I had picked up earlier) in the middle of the day, in the shade of a banyan tree.</p>

<p>The riding was tough, hot. But that was me rather than the road. I stopped to eat a snack (two chicken buns that I had picked up earlier) in the middle of the day, in the shade of a banyan tree. My water bottles in the panniers had heated up so it seemed prudent to eat my lunch while it was still relatively fresh.</p>

<p>Next to my shady banyan, a Hindu temple was under construction although no one was in evidence while I wandered about.</p>

<p>My plan for the evening was to stay at the Rose Lagoon Hotel, on the south side of Varakai. It would make for a long day. Before commiting myself to that last thirty kilometres, I phoned the hotel but no-one picked up. A mobile number mentioned on their website either no longer existed or was turned off. So, should I turn left and take a minor road where there was reputedly a hotel? I sent a Whatsapp message to the Rose Lagoon, decided to risk it, and carried on; if I stopped too soon, I would probably have to break my journey again before reaching Batticaloa.</p>

<p>My weather app told me it was 33C but 'feels like 42C'</p>

<p>Roadside shack proprietors, where I stopped for fizzy, sweet but, most importantly, cold drinks informed that it was hot. No one seemed to be moving quickly or expending unnecessary energy.</p>

<p>A WhatsApp message, from the owner of the Rose Lagoon, apologising for not being able to answer the phone but he was at the hospital and the hotel was closed. I asked if there were altenatives and, yes, a new hotel and also rooms at the army camp.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when I arrived at the Beacon Hotel. No answer to my knock so I opened the gate and wheeled in. Completely deserted. I went to a building at the rear and knocked on the door. No one. And no vehicle. Army camp it is!</p>

<p>Only it wasn't. When I arrived, there was a convenience store and a sign for rooms but they were fully booked! How can that be? Everywhere else I've stayed, I've been pretty much the only guest. Is it to a night in a field, I wondered.</p>

<p>Rather than ride off into the dark, I hung around while lots of discussions in Sinhala considered options. No, I said, the Rose Lagoon was closed tonight and the Beacon was like the Marie Celeste. A local offered to show me a room 500 m back up the road so we cycled off into the dark. Back to the Beacon, which remained deserted. My helper shrugged his head and went home &ndash; and I returned to the army camp.</p>

<p>More discussions, in Sinhala, ensued. With finger pointing in various directions as a small crowd tried to solve my dilemma. Phone calls were made. I stocked up on water for whatever the night would bring. Then I was told to wait for five minutes. Some time later, a man (a soldier but out of uniform) arrived on a motorcycle and led me back to the Beacon, which was not lit up. With a security man on guard outside. We went into the grounds, and more conversations I wasn't privy to determined, apparently, that the manager had gone home and he had the key; the hotel was closed. So I turned my back on the Beacon for the third time.</p>

<p>Time was passing. I was tired and hungry with any benefit from two chicken buns long since used up. At the army camp, more phone calls, and the phone was passed to me. I spoke to a man in English who apologised and said that his Beach Cottage wasn't available but he'd check about a place next door and see whether they would accept a walk-in. Hang tight.</p>

<p>Success. I had somewhere to sleep. I wasn't exactly sure where but my friend on the motorcycle would guide me. I'll be slow, I warned, on my bike without lights in the dark. But his friend, a commando (I leearned later), decided he would ride my bike! I wasn't sure what to make of this but got on the back of the motorcycle and the three of us went south for a few kilometres, past the empty Rose Lagoon Hotel, to a road junction. Where someone from where I was about to stay had come to lead us the final couple of kilometres. But the road was, apparently, dangerous and I would have to stay on the motor cycle pillion. A narrow lane, then road works &ndash; a single 'lane' of crushed, tamped and watered gravel &ndash; and a truck coming towards us. People were working on the road, a large rubber-tyred vehicle vibrating and compacting the gravel. We had to take to the ditch to get by but managed without mishap and continued to a home. The man, a Canadian who had lived in Toronto for 24 years, who had arranged my accommodation checked that everything was alright. His wife, who was in the shadows but may have been Sri Lankan, had just arrived from Toronto.</p>

<p>And, fifty metres on, an open gate to Shillativu Lodge. I thank my two army friends (the commando had done well on the bike; I had quickly explained the gears to him but I'm not sure he had changed gear) and gave them a few dollars for beer. Then unloaded my bike into a very pleasant room. A cup of tea was provided, but I'd have to go without dinner. There were two workers and me. The 'girls' hadn't left any food; there was only one meal for the two of them.</p>

<p>The most expensive stay of my trip to Sri Lanka and no dinner! Well, I did have a packet of ginger snaps and plenty of water.</p>

    (76.6 km, 165 m, 1850.9 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Breakfast in a bakery and then on to the already hot road. The heat definitely feels more oppressive these days. But it might be that I'm getting tired of it. Maybe even a little tired of being on the bike, too. Too many uninteresting roads in the north; I'm missing those deserted roads through the southern countryside. And, perhaps, the novelty of Sri Lanka is starting to wear off.</p>
