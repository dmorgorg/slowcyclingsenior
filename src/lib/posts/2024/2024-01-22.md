<b>17th January, 2024. Colombo.</b>
The flight was long but reasonable. I got involved watching most of the first season of Riverdance - a really weird show - and didn't sleep much.

Entry in Sri Lanka was pretty relaxed. Scan of my passport, scan of my landing slip, and I was through. Not a word from the immigration officer: I guess this event was more exciting for me than it was for him. My bike (not the only one - a couple of other riders were there for a six day tours, a complimentary trip of some sort for sponsored gravel riders?) was ready when I got there so I wandered off to get money.

Even that was easy. I went to an ATM no other new arrivals were waiting in line for and withdrew 4000/-. I had intended 40.000/- but must have missed a zero. I arranged a taxi (slight pushiness from the touts but nothing like India) and, when I went to pay, I didn't have enough money. 4000/- is less than C$17 which wasn't going to get me very far. Back to the ATM, which this time refused to give me anything on my Wise card or on my Visa. So I got to stand in the line with everyone else. Again my Wise card was declined, most likely because I may have picked the wrong account to withdraw money from - I only have one on the Wise and I was given three options. Money from Visa was no problem and I was soon in the taxi.

<b>21st January, 2024. Colombo.</b>

Took a tuk tuk to the fort area and walked about, not sure where. I looked at the European clock tower (with what looked like a lighthouse light on top of it) and was approached by my second tout in a few minutes. He told me his name but I don't remember it. He was the bar manager at a hotel he pointed at, but on a break, heading to see a special Buddhist festival starting shortly a few minutes walk away. We walked for more than a few minutes, he looked at his watch and gave the impression we were late. Miraculously, just then a tuk tuk parked ahead of us, and my 'friend' told me to get the red tuk tuks because they were on a meter. I, gullibly, allowed myself to get in the tuk tuk after I heard him say "Festival, on the meter!" A kilometre further and I (never one to miss a trick...clearly) knew something was going on. We pulled in to a "thousand year old Hindu Temple for me to take a photo. But I didn't want to. On to the Buddhist festival, with its many advertised elephants, but first we stopped at the Buddhist temple. My dander was up, having been conned, and said I didn't want to go any further. This was not good news for the team. How much for the tuk tuk, I asked the driver. 3,300/- was the reply. "No, that's ridiculous. You said this was on the meter and the driver pointed to his speedometer mileometer. "No that's not a meter. You two are working together." They protested their innocence and I asked my 'friend' to let me out. "1,000 rupees" the driver sullenly demanded. I gave him 500 and a piece of my mind. (For context, the tuk tuk I had taken from my homestay had been about 650/- and was five times the distance.) I'd learnt a cheap lesson &ndash; to be always on my guard. And the tuk tuk had cost me about C$2.10. Clearly, almost ten years away from Asia and I needed to relearn a few lessons.
