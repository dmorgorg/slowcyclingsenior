<h5>
  	Galisteo. 25th May, 2024
</h5>

<p>A recovery day. Walked steeply to the wall around town and strolled around the outside. Then up on to the wall ramparts for a while. Then through the town a bit, a bar for caf&eacute; con leche, a visit to Spar for supplies &ndash; for the morrow since the store appears to be closed on Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday. </p>
<p>Quite fresh sitting outside the wall in the shade and the breeze but toasty in the sun. The last census, in 2006, gave the population at 2,000. Not many for the apparent number of houses. And maybe less now. I saw about thirty of them. Three bars or so in the town but no restaurant. A small grocery store. No restaurant within the walls; a single restaurant outside. A few <i>se vende</i> signs.</p>
