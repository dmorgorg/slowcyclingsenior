<h5>
  	5th April, 2024.
  	Batticaloa - Mahaoya<br/>
    (69.8 km, 344 m, 1920.7 km to date)
</h5>

<p>After bread, eggs and tea I was on my way, back down the peninsula, over the bridge into Batti and turning west. Where things went awry. My route indicated straight on &ndash; but the sign said "Airpost" and the closed gates with a couple of armed soldiers on guard seemed to suggest otherwise. I turned left, with the majority of the traffic, and Wahoo rerouted me, showing a lengthier way on a reasonable-looking road. But I lost the traffic and my suggested road degenerated into gravel, then a track, and finally a path. A murder of crows squawked that I had no business there and I was inclined to agree.</p>

<p> The path narrowed, along a slim dyke with a lake on one side and dry paddy fields on the other. The lake was pretty, the path less so. It disappeared for a while where a drainage entered from the fields, and I dropped down and pushed across a slimy creek. The water felt hot. Pushing up the other side, something felt wrong with one of my Chacos sandals, the right one, and I looked down to see that the outside strap at the back had come away from the sole and flapped uselessly.</p>

<p>This was a potential problem, these Chacos being the only footwear I had in Sri Lanka. I continued through the dry fields, up onto the path for a while with a road in sight in the near distance. Some walking, some riding, one slow motion fall into the dirt with the bike almost on top of me. Mmm, not the most auspicious of starts &ndash; maybe staying in Batti and swimming daily, with good food and access to beer, had been the better plan? Up to the road and right, courtesy of my rerouting, and back towards Batti. A sign indicating the airport was not encouraging - this whole detour had been to get around the airport. </p>

<p>I pressed on until I found myself back on terrain I had cycled almost an hour before; my software wanted me to go around (and around?) again. No, I don't think so! I headed back to where the original obstacle &ndash; the gate, the airport, the armed guards &ndash; and took the other option. It was quite pleasant, a narrow road or causeway between lakes, an incongruous 'Stop' sign on a stretch with no intersections in sight, and carried on until I decided a closer look at the map would be sensible.</p>

<p> With the sun so high in the sky, my sense of direction can be suspect. Wrong again, turn around, retrace the part of the route I'd ridden after my paddy field sojourn, and continue on the road I should have been on in the first place. Wahoo, or Komoot, or whatever had sent me right (wrongly) when left would have been right (correct). Too much time and energy wasted and the sun was baking. It was the hottest day so far.</p>

<p>It was a nice, quiet landscape. With few shade trees. But those that there were, were fully utilised as I took whatever time out of the sun that I could justify. I had plenty of water with me but it heated up quickly in my black panniers and was very warm so I did stop at roadside places that looked to have refrigerators.</p>

<p>Cycling with a broken sandal was surprisingly unproblematic, once my foot was planted on the pedal. The well-contoured supportive foot bed certainly helped. Walking worked too although not as well; it felt like walking in one sandal and one flipflop.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day, I braked for another cold water stop. And my rear brake complained mightily; something was wrong. I inhaled a litre of pleasantly cool water and set to work. I couldn't see much &ndash; my all-purpose prescription sunglasses are not particularly good for close up even when they are clean, and they were nothing like clean &ndash; but the rear wheel would not spin. I just backed off the brake pads until the wheel spun (almost) freely. There was precious little downhill to worry about and a good front brake should suffice.</p>

<p>My hotel was mildly disappointing, considering its (relatively) upmarket price. But I did get dinner, and an opportunity to replace my rear brake pads. They were worn and the spring that separated them had failed.

    6th April, 2024.
  	Mahaoya - Mahiyanganaya<br/>
    (53.5 km, 455 m, 1974.2 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Back on the still relatively quiet road and starting to gain a little elevation. More beautiful large trees.</p>

<p>My rear brake required a bit of attention. The lever was squishy, not engaging until fully retracted and consequently without much stopping power. A quick and simple fix: a quick rotation of the adjustment bolts on each side of the caliper and on I went. (Maybe too quick and simple; I should have verified that the wheel still spun freely but my 'wrenching' skills are not highly developed.)</p>

<p>A sign caught my eye. It was hot, I was tired and the sign made me laugh. A little, at least. So I stopped for a photo. And noticed what looked like water bottles in the adjacent store.</p>

<p>Only they weren't water bottles. They were automotive fluid of some kind; it was a motor cycle repair shop. A man was attacking the steering of a motorcycle with a hammer and screwdriver. Yes, they had water but none cold. But he jumped on (a different) bike and roared across the road and down a bit, returning with a litre of nice, cold aqua for me to imbibe in front of a growing audience. A smiling mum who had arrived on a scooter with her shy little boy. Wanderers by, come to share in the excitement or a foreign visitor. </p>

<p>The day seemed long. And harder than it should have? I made it to the tongue-twisting town of MaMahiyanganaya and settled in to the pleasant New Rest Hotel. They fed me. And I slept well.

  7th April, 2024.
  	Mahiyanganaya - ?<br/>
    (18.0 km, 682 m, 1992.2 km to date)
</h5>

<p>This was to be the tough one. Up, seriously up, into the hills. (But only 'seriously' due to the combination of loaded bike, tropical temperatures, elevation gain and septagenaria) A shortish day (34 km) was planned because of the almost 1100 m of elevation gain. I had reserved a room, for two nights, accordingly. Thinking a rest day might be in order before continuing to Kandy, another trying day, longer but a little less elevation to contend with.</p>

<p>At breakfast outside my room, I noticed a green lizard also breakfasting. On passing insects too small to see. Its body was about 10 cm in length but its tail stretched an impressive 30 cm or so.</p>

<p>My old friends that have cycled in Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, France and Spain have finally had enough. Repair, I'm sure, is possible at home but they are need resoling too. Repairs have to be sent in to the company in the States so it's simpler and cost-effective to get a new pair. They are ordered and should arrive in Greenwich before my ride in Spain at the beginning of May.</p>

<p>The rear straps are independent of the front, styling straps. Maybe an ingenious local cobbler could fashion a way to thread one strap back through the sole and stitch it to the other strap, thereby effecting a repair. But I'm not in a town at the moment, esconsed away at Knuckles Range Bungalow. Maybe the housekeeper could try to get them fixed when he goes in? I'll have to enquire.</p>

<p>What to do? My legs are (still) very tired from the uphill efforts and the day to Kandy is easily as hard as what I managed before I escaped into a tuktuk: as much elevation gain and two to three times the horizontal. Then two days to Nugegoda, with the long urban haul into the crowded capital. Or I could recognise that there is nothing (more) for me to prove: I could rest up, read, relax here and try to arrange a ride for me and Broadie to the Leisure Home in time for New Year. Why not?</p>
