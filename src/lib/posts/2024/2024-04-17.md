<p>After bread, eggs and tea I was on my way, back down the peninsula, over the bridge into Batti and turning west. Where things went awry. My route indicated straight on but the closed gates with a couple of armed soldiers on guard seemed to suggest otherwise. I turned left, with the majority of the traffic, and Wahoo rerouted me, showing a lengthier way on a reasonable-looking road. But I lost the traffic and the road degenerated into gravel, then a track, and finally a path. A murder of crows squawked that I had no business there and I was inclined to agree.</p>

<p> The path narrowed, along a slim dyke with a lake on one side and dry paddy fields on the other. The lake was pretty, the path less so. It disappeared for a while where a drainage entered from the fields, and I dropped down and push across a slimy creek. The water felt hot. Pushing up the other side, something felt wrong with one of my Chacos, the right one, and I looked down to see that the outside strap at the back had come away from the sole and flapped uselessly.</p>

<p>This was a potential problem, these Chacos being the only footwear I had in Sri Lanka. I continued through the dry fields, up onto the path for a while with a road in sight in the near distance. Some walking, some riding,one slow motion fall with the bike almost on top of me. Mmm, not the greatest of starts. Up to the road and right, courtesy of my rerouting, and back towards Batti. A sign indicating the airport was not encouraging - this detour had been to get around the airport. I pressed on until I found myself back on terrain I had cycled almost an hour before; my software wanted me to go around (and around?) again. Nope. I headed back to where the original obstacle &ndash; the gate, the airport, the armed guards &ndash; and took the other option. It was quite pleasant, a narrow road or causeway between lakes, an incongruous 'Stop' sign on a section with no intersections in sight, and carried on until I decided a closer look at the map would be sensible. With the sun so high in the sky, my sense of direction can be suspect. Wrong again, turn around, retrace the part of the route I'd ridden after my paddy field sojourn, and continue on the road I should have been on in the first place. Wahoo, or Komoot, or whatever had sent me right (wrongly) when left would have been right (correct). Too much time and energy wasted and the sun was baking.And it was the hottest day so far.</p>
