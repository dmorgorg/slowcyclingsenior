<h5>
  	5th April, 2024.
  	Batticaloa - Mahaoya<br/>
    (69.8 km, 344 m, 1920.7 km to date)
</h5>

<p>After bread, eggs and tea I was on my way, back down the peninsula, over the bridge into Batti and turning west. Where things went awry. My route indicated straight on &ndash; but the sign said "Airpost" and the closed gates with a couple of armed soldiers on guard seemed to suggest otherwise. I turned left, with the majority of the traffic, and Wahoo rerouted me, showing a lengthier way on a reasonable-looking road. But I lost the traffic and my suggested road degenerated into gravel, then a track, and finally a path. A murder of crows squawked that I had no business there and I was inclined to agree.</p>

<p> The path narrowed, along a slim dyke with a lake on one side and dry paddy fields on the other. The lake was pretty, the path less so. It disappeared for a while where a drainage entered from the fields, and I dropped down and pushed across a slimy creek. The water felt hot. Pushing up the other side, something felt wrong with one of my Chacos sandals, the right one, and I looked down to see that the outside strap at the back had come away from the sole and flapped uselessly.</p>

<p>This was a potential problem, these Chacos being the only footwear I had in Sri Lanka. I continued through the dry fields, up onto the path for a while with a road in sight in the near distance. Some walking, some riding, one slow motion fall into the dirt with the bike almost on top of me. Mmm, not the most auspicious of starts &ndash; maybe staying in Batti and swimming daily, with good food and access to beer, had been the better plan? Up to the road and right, courtesy of my rerouting, and back towards Batti. A sign indicating the airport was not encouraging - this whole detour had been to get around the airport. </p>

<p>I pressed on until I found myself back on terrain I had cycled almost an hour before; my software wanted me to go around (and around?) again. No, I don't think so! I headed back to where the original obstacle &ndash; the gate, the airport, the armed guards &ndash; and took the other option. It was quite pleasant, a narrow road or causeway between lakes, an incongruous 'Stop' sign on a stretch with no intersections in sight, and carried on until I decided a closer look at the map would be sensible.</p>

<p> With the sun so high in the sky, my sense of direction can be suspect. Wrong again, turn around, retrace the part of the route I'd ridden after my paddy field sojourn, and continue on the road I should have been on in the first place. Wahoo, or Komoot, or whatever had sent me right (wrongly) when left would have been right (correct). Too much time and energy wasted and the sun was baking. It was the hottest day so far.</p>

<p>It was a nice, quiet landscape. With few shade trees. But those that there were, were fully utilised as I took whatever time out of the sun that I could justify. I had plenty of water with me but it heated up quickly in my black panniers and was very warm so I did stop at roadside places that looked to have refrigerators.</p>

<p>Cycling with a broken sandal was surprisingly unproblematic, once my foot was planted on the pedal. The well-contoured supportive foot bed certainly helped. Walking worked too although not as well; it felt like walking in one sandal and one flipflop.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day, I braked for another cold water stop. And my rear brake complained mightily; something was wrong. I inhaled a litre of pleasantly cool water and set to work. I couldn't see much &ndash; my all-purpose prescription sunglasses are not particularly good for close up even when they are clean, and they were nothing like clean &ndash; but the rear wheel would not spin. I just backed off the brake pads until the wheel spun (almost) freely. There was precious little downhill to worry about and a good front brake should suffice.</p>

<p>My hotel was mildly disappointing, considering its (relatively) upmarket price. But I did get dinner, and an opportunity to replace my rear brake pads. They were worn and the spring that separated them had failed.

<p>At breakfast outside my room, I noticed a green lizard also breakfasting. On passing insects too small to see. Its body was about 10 cm in length but its tail stretched an impressive 30 cm or so.</p>

<p>My old friends that have cycled in Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, France and Spain have finally had enough. Repair, I'm sure, is possible at home but they are need resoling too. Repairs have to be sent in to the company in the States so it's simpler and cost-effective to get a new pair. They are ordered and should arrive before my ride in Spain at the beginning of May.</p>
