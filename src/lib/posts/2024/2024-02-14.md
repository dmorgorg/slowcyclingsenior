<h5>
  	9th February, 2024
  	<br />Batticaloa to Welikanda
</h5>
(84.5 km, 273 m, 662.2 km to date)
<p>I had two options to consider: I could continue to hang out and relax in Batticoloa; or I could get back on the bike and work my way back to Colombo in time to meet Bev off her flight on the 14th February. It was too far to go in the time I had remaining but, if I was close enough, public transport might be possible. Pat and Julie said trains were easy, although it was necessary to take all the attachments off the bike (framebag and handlebar roll &ndash; a bit of a drag but doable). Buses work too, apparently. And if I got close enough, maybe a tuktuk? </p>

  <p>I rode back down the peninsula I had been staying on to get back on route, and into &ndash; then through &ndash; Batticaloa.</p>

  <p>Following the coast northward, along the sparsely populated coastline, there were areas of gravestones. Presumably a legacy of the tsunami on 26th December, 2004. It was the woman and children who suffered the majority of the fatalities. The men had been at work, at sea, where the tsunami was not a problem. The wave only grew to its devastating proportions when the water became shallow at the coastline.</p>

  <p>Komoot got up to its usual tricks, sending me down a dirt road that diminished to rough double track, which disappeared under water. I was pondering what to do when I heard a tractor approaching. It went through the water with barely a pause but it looked at least waist height for me. Not too promising.</p>

  <p>I toyed briefly with the idea of trying to get the driver to ferry me and my bike across but I didn't know what lay ahead and I didn't relish finding myself trapped between two water crossings. Time to retrace...</p>
  <p>A helpful villager showed me a better route, presumably informed by the two men on the tractor of my dilemma. I pushed my bike down a deep, sandy path, feeling the heat, until we were again stopped by water. My guide went ahead. The water wasn't much above knee-height and he beckoned me to follow. Nah. Then he suggested (all with the usual sign language) that we could both carry the bike. I decided (it didn't take much thought) to return to the road. If I kept going north on roads, I'd be heading more or less where I wanted to be going.</p>

  <p>Some time later, I resumed my Komoot route. And, guess what? Another water obstacle in the middle of a village. I asked a friendly little girl (sign language again) whether I coud cross &ndash; this one looked much more reasonable. The girl indicated waist-high but she may have been trolling me. She wandered across with the water only mid-calf. I could manage this.</p>

  <p>More Kamoot routing along narrow paths through fields. But however unlikely the route looked, it came through now.</p>
  <p>And then I came to the main highway from Batticaloa. Just a matter of plodding on and finding somewhere to stay. Slim pickings; I stopped at a place that was full. It looked like a place where transport drivers would stop for the night. I asked the proprietor if he knew of anywhere for me to stay and, miraculously, he had a room. And dinner &ndash; "village food."</p>
  <p>It was Friday night and his daughter was studying math with a tutor. Old abbreviations that I remembered from school: <i>f</i> for acceleration rather than <i>a</i>, <i>P</i> for force rather than <i>F</i>. I retired to my very basic room rather than interrupt her studying.</p>

<p>Mainly on the main road today. Nothing exceptionally interesting. But I got some miles in.</p>

<p>Not only leopards but crocodiles and elephants were on offer as I rode alongside one of Sri Lanka's national parks. But all I saw were monkey congregating where there were piles of garbage.</p>

(54.2 km, 544 m, 941.4 km to date)
<p>A hot, grubby unexciting slog through Colombo to Negogoda. But I made back in time to pick up my sweetheart at the airport! I still don't know how easy it is to put my bike on a train or bus, or fit it in a tuktuk.</p>
