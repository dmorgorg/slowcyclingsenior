  	28th February, 2024.<br/>
  	A lovely train ride from Kandy to Ella
</h5>

<p>Well, the train didn't leave exactly from Kandy. We took a tuktuk from our hotel in Kandy to Perideniya, about six kilometres away. I suspect that Kandy is on a spur line, off the main Colombo to Badulla route, and is only travelled by those trains that originate or terminate in Kandy.</p>

<p>In any event, we hadn't been able to book a seat in the 'observation car' from Kandy, whether because it didn't go there or because it was fully booked on the date we wanted. So off to Peradeniya Junction we tuktukked.</p>

<p>Although this was to be our first time on a train in Sri Lanka, the station had the familiar South Asian railway station feel, made even more welcoming by the chill Sri Lankan vibe (not some common in India!). Most of the assembled passengers; we are definitely on the tourist trail.</p>

<p>We arrived about 90 minutes early and the train was about half-an-hour late but it was a pleasant enough place to wait. And the tea was good.</p>

<p>The blind artisan was re-"stringing" (or "recaning"?) this chair by feel.</p>

<p>Our train arrived, we found our seats, and were off! The observation car had a large window facing back down the track, and all the seats faced backwards. </p>

<p>It wouldn't have hurt to have washed the windows recently (even weekly?), for the sake of sharper photographs!</p>

<p>It felt really good to be on a train in South Asia again, after a break of around ten years. Such a civilised way to travel! :) </p>
<p>The ride didn't seem quite as smooth as those I remembered from India but that might have been due to me not being as steady on my feet ten years on.</p>

<p>And then, as it grew dark, we rolled in to Ella. The tuktuk driver was waiting (and had been for an hour or so) to shuttle us to his family's very nice lodgings. A quick shower, and off to dinner. A limited, though not necessarily in price, offered pizza. It was none too exciting but couldn't take the edge off a magnificent day.</p>

      Ella, and a bit of magic.
  </h5>
  <p>Ella was planned as a relaxation few days with no real itinerary. Our room, with its airy balcony, had wonderful views of the surrounding hills. We could see some of the railway line, too. And hear the trains, which sounded strangely like a helicopter from our vantage point. At 1100+ metres above sea-level, the temperature was very pleasant. A welcome relief!</p>

  <p>Being enamoured of most things railway-related, a visit to the acclaimed nine-arches bridge was required. We tuktukked (?) into town and set off on a pleasant trail through the trees. </p>
