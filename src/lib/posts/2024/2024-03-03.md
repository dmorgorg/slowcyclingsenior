  	28th February, 2024.<br/>
  	A lovely train ride from Kandy to Ella
</h5>

<p>Well, the train didn't leave exactly from Kandy. We took a tuktuk from our hotel in Kandy to Perideniya, about six kilometres away. I suspect that Kandy is on a spur line, off the main Colombo to Badulla route, and is only travelled by those trains that originate or terminate in Kandy.</p>

<p>In any event, we hadn't been able to book a seat in the 'observation car' from Kandy, whether because it didn't go there or because it was fully booked on the date we wanted. So off to Peradeniya Junction we tuktukked.</p>

<p>Although this was to be our first time on a train in Sri Lanka, the station had the familiar South Asian railway station feel, made even more welcoming by the more chill Sri Lankan vibe. Not all the passengers assembled there were Western but a majority of them were. We are definitely on the tourist route.</p>

<p>We arrived about 90 minutes early and the train was about half-an-hour late but it was a pleasant enough place to wait. And the tea was good.</p>

<p>The our train arrived, we found our seats, and were off! The observation car had a large window facing back down the track, and all the seats were orientated backwards.</p>

<p>It wouldn't have hurt to have washed the windows to remove the blurry areas!</p>

<p>It felt really good to be riding a train in South Asia again, after a break of around ten years. Such a civilised way to travel :) </p>
<p>The ride didn't seem quite as smooth as those I remembered in India but that might have been due to me not being as steady on my feet ten years on.</p>
