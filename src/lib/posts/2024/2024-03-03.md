  	28th February, 2024.<br/>
  	A lovely train ride from Kandy to Ella
</h5>

<p>Well, the train didn't leave exactly from Kandy. We took a tuktuk from our hotel in Kandy to Perideniya, about six kilometres away. I suspect that Kandy is on a spur line, off the main Colombo to Badulla route, and is only travelled by those trains that originate or terminate in Kandy.</p>

<p>In any event, we hadn't been able to book a seat in the 'observation car' from Kandy, whether because it didn't go there or because it was fully booked on the date we wanted. So off to Peradeniya Junction we tuktukked.</p>

<p>Although this was to be our first time on a train in Sri Lanka, the station had the familiar South Asian railway station feel, made even more welcoming by the chill Sri Lankan vibe (not so common in India!). Most of the assembled passengers were Western; we are definitely on a well-beaten tourist trail.</p>

<p>We arrived at the station about 90 minutes early and the train was about half-an-hour late but it was a pleasant enough place to wait. There is always something going on at a railway station, something to watch. And the tea was good &ndash; milky and sweet.</p>

<p>The blind artisan was re-"stringing" (or "recaning"?) this chair by feel.</p>

<p>Our train arrived, we found our seats, and were off! The observation car had a large window facing back down the track, and all the seats faced backwards. </p>

<p>It wouldn't have hurt to have washed the windows recently (even weekly?), for the sake of sharper photographs!</p>

<p>It felt really good to be on a train in South Asia again, after a break of around ten years. Such a civilised way to travel! :) </p>
<p>The ride didn't seem quite as smooth as those I remembered from India but that might have been due to me not being as steady on my feet ten years on rather than simply the maintenance state of the track.</p>

<p>And then, as it grew dark, we rolled in to Ella. The tuktuk driver was waiting (and had been for an hour or so) to shuttle us to his family's very nice lodgings. A quick shower, and off to dinner. A limited menu (though not unfortunately in price) offered pizza. It was none too exciting but couldn't take the edge off a magnificent day.</p>

      Ella, and a bit of magic.
  </h5>
  <p>Ella was planned as a relaxation few days with no real itinerary. Our room, with its airy balcony, had wonderful views of the surrounding hills. We could see some of the railway line, too. And hear the trains, which sounded strangely like a helicopter from our vantage point. At 1100+ metres above sea-level, the temperature was very pleasant. A welcome relief!</p>

  <p>Being enamoured of most things railway-related, a visit to the acclaimed nine-arches bridge was required. We tuktukked (?) into town and set off on a pleasant trail through the trees. </p>

  <p>When we arrived at the bridge, we saw that many others had received the same memo...</p>

  <p>We decided on a relaxed stroll back down the railway line for a couple of kilometres to Ella.</p>

  <p>We had an unexciting meal in Ella, waited in line at an ATM for it to choke on my request and shut down for maintenance, then called for a tuktuk back up the hill to our island of peace. (The peace was disturbed a bit to learn that both cash withdrawals, the one that hadn't worked and the one that had, were charged to my account. Calls to Visa's support line had me jumping through the usual hoops and, just as I thought I would be able to talk to a human, cut me off. Three times, at the same stage in the process. The error did resolve itself over the next couple of days but it didn't say much for how Visa treats potential fraud.)</p>

    <p>This little guy was a regular visitor to the Will Guest Homestay papaya tree while we had breakfast. Did you know that papaya trees are planted anew each year, and chopped down when the fruit has all been harvested? The trunks appear to be hollow. This one is about eight months old.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon one day, I heard all the dogs barking and looked out to see what was causing all the fuss in time to see an elephant being lead up the road. That evening, Bev asked about the elephant and we learned that there was to be a religious celebration the following evening at a village about six kilometres up the road. And, yes, we could attend!</p>
  <p>The Kandy Perahera is one of the country's most spectacular processions with visitors from all over the island. It is in July or August. Our Perahera occurs regularly in March.</p>
  <p>One of Will's sons drove us up the location the following evening in the homestay tuktuk. We waited at the side of the road, alongside neat tea plantations. The road was lined with locals buzzing with excitement. We had little idea what to expect, and for an hour or so nothing happened. Then what sounded like loud firecrackers but was a group of men with whips that they swirled and cracked, effectively clearing the road ahead! They were either very skilled, or we were very lucky, not to be lacerated as we leant out of the way into the tea plants. </p>
  <p>Then, for an hour or more, a noisy procession passed us. Drummers. Dancers. Pipers. Elephants. Five of them, gaily lit up against the night sky, doing their own dance, heads shifting from side to side. Fortunately, all appeared to be in a good mood. Some of the dancers were in costumes identical to those we had seen a few days before at the cultural dance performance near Sigiriya although the performance a little less polished but no less inspiring for that.</p>
  <p>Superlatives generally get overused but this did feel a very special occasion that we were privileged to witness.</p>
