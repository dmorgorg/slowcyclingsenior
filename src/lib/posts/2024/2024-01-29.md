<h5>
  	24th January, 2024
  	<br /> Colombo to Panadura
  </h5>
  (31.5 km, 114 m, 49.9 km to date)

Not the earliest of starts &ndash; but when are they? I had to wait until 10:00 am for breakfast to be served but I wasn't going far so it wasn't a concern. Mild nerves before setting out, as is usual. But not having a fixed destination for the trip (apart from back to Colombo in three weeks to meet my wife at the airport!) and no real plans seems to be successful in removing the worst of the stress. I'm just going for a ride in the sun! Ha.

Half-an-hour pretty much due west brought to the ocean, and a left turn had me heading south. Busy with traffic but not too worrying. Drawn out urban areas but generally with the bright blue water close by on my right. Hot but bearable. The bike seems fine and I appreciated having less than my usual load. 40 lb less? Maybe.

It all feels very familiar: on a bike, in Asia. The traffic is quieter, and the vehicles more modern than in India. No vehicles with "Sound Horn" signs on the back (those signs really seem to work, too). No piles of stinking garbage either, not so much abject poverty, and nothing dramatically unfamiliar.

About three hours and 30 km in, I had covered the distance I'd hoped for the day. No negative feedback from my ankle or knees. I went a little past Panadura in search of comfortable digs; since it was still early, I rode to the hotel I had my eyes on without booking ahead. No problem. A somewhat over-the-top new hotel (with obvious signs of future ambitions to extend upwards) was happy to accommodate me for the reasonable fee of US$20. The room, up one floor (a test that my knees passed) was spacious and spotless.

Apparently 50 rooms but I counted fewer, about a third of that, and as yet I am the only guest. Chef, manager and two or three kitchen help weren't going to get far on my $20.

<p>I spent a couple of hours horizontal on the bed, enjoying the AC, but with the sun beginning to get lower I walked out towards the beach, thirty or forty yards away on the other side of the railway tracks.</p>

<p>As far as I could tell from the passing trains (they were fairly regular), they were almost full but with plenty of room available. A couple at the Leisure Home had been unable to reserve a seat on the train at short notice so settled on the bus; it looked like the train would be fine.</p>

<p>I stayed for the sunset which was not spectacular, disappearing into cloud before reaching the horizon.</p>

<p>Even with the sun almost gone, it was hot. Sitting quietly and still, I could feel the trickles of sweat creeping down my face and back.</p>

  <p>The flight was long but reasonable. I got involved watching most of the first season of Riverdance - a really weird show - and didn't sleep much.</p>

  <p>Entry into Sri Lanka was pretty relaxed. Scan of my passport, scan of my landing slip, and I was through. Not a word from the immigration officer: I guess this event was more exciting for me than it was for him. My bike (not the only one - a couple of other riders were there for a six day tour, a complimentary trip of some sort for sponsored gravel riders?) was ready when I got there so I wheeled the bike in its bag and the pannier I had carried-on on the airport trolley off to get money.</p>

  <p>Even that was easy. I went to an ATM no other new arrivals were waiting in line for and withdrew 4000/-. I had intended 40.000/- but must have missed a zero. I arranged a taxi (slight pushiness from the touts but nothing like India) and, when I went to pay, I didn't have enough money. 4000/- is less than C$17 which wasn't going to get me very far. Back to the ATM, which this time refused to give me anything on my Wise card or on my Visa. So I got to stand in the line with everyone else. Again my Wise card was declined, most likely because I may have picked the wrong account to withdraw money from - I only have one on the Wise and I was given three options. Money from Visa was no problem and I was soon in the taxi.</p>

<p>Took a tuk tuk to the Fort area and walked about, not sure where to go, what to do. I looked at the European clock tower (with what looked like a lighthouse light on top of it) and was approached by my second tout in a few minutes. He told me his name but I don't remember it. He was (or claimed to be) the bar manager at an adjacent hotel he pointed to, but on a break, heading to see a special Buddhist festival starting shortly just a few minutes walk away. Lots of elephants!</p>
<p>He dropped in beside me and we walked for more than the promised few minutes. Then he looked at his watch and gave the impression we were late for the festival start. Miraculously, just then a tuk tuk parked ahead of us, and my 'friend' told me to get the red tuk tuks because they were on a meter. I, gullibly, allowed myself to get in the tuk tuk after I heard him say "Festival, on the meter!" A kilometre further and I (never one to miss a trick...clearly) knew something was going on.</p>
<p>We pulled in to a "thousand-years-old" Hindu Temple for me to take a photo. But I said that I didn't want to take a photo, getting annoyed at the direction this "chance" encounter was taking. On to the Buddhist festival, with its many advertised elephants, but first we stopped at the Buddhist temple. My dander was up, having been conned, and said I didn't want to go any further.</p>
<p>This was not good news for the team. "How much for the tuk tuk?" I asked the driver. 3,300/- was the reply. "No, that's ridiculous. You said this was on the meter and the driver pointed to his speedometer mileometer. "No that's not a meter. You two are working together." They protested their innocence and I asked my 'friend' to move aside and let me out. "1,000 rupees" the driver sullenly demanded, complaining about the cost of fuel. I gave him 500 and a piece of my mind. (For context, the tuk tuk I had taken from my homestay had been about 650/- and was five times the distance.)</p>
<p>I'd learnt a cheap lesson &ndash; to be always on my guard. The tuk tuk had only cost me C$2.10. Clearly, after almost ten years away from Asia, I need to relearn a few lessons. Luckily, no harm done. Not even to my pride (such as it is these days!)</p>
<p>But I was outside the temple so in I went.</p>

<p>And just a few steps from the temple, there was indeed an elephant!</p>

<p>I wandered slowly back in the direction of the fort. Some interesting architecture and a lovely old banyan tree along the way.</p>

<p>I returned to a Leisure Home in turmoil. And gained a little insight into Sri Lankan culture.</p>
<Callout>A little background: Madu had married an Iranian (whom she met while studying in Germany) and was kicked out of her family for marrying a non-Buddhist. When their son (Shihath?) was two years old, her husband went to work in Syria. Madu didn't want to go so her husband asked to have a second wife. Nope. They divorced. Madu was estranged from her family and a single mother. </Callout>
<p>"Oh Dave, a terrible thing has happened! And I can't cook for you tonight. I'd chopped all the vegetables but then a bad phone call and my head is exploding and I cannot cook. I have ordered biriani for you.</p>
<p>What had happened spilled out. Shihath had played an online group game with his cousin on the estranged side. And invited a girl to join them. Now his cousin and the girl were in an inappropriate relationship, and the cousin's parents had phoned to raise stink. It was all Shihath's fault for introducing them - apparently how blame is sometimes apportioned here. It's not the boy and girl's fault for what they did but the fault of the person who introduced them.</p>
