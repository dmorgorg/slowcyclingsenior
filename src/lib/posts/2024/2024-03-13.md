<h5>
  	3rd March, 2024.<br/>
  	To Rukewa
</h5>

<p>Time for a break from travel and some lazy time before returning to Colombo for Bev's flight back to the UK and then home to Canada.</p>

<p>Will's son wasn't available to drive us to Rukewa, a location on the south coast that Bev had picked out. We had a ride with one of Will's sons' 'brother.' Not in the literal sense, I presume. A more stylish young man in a slightly sportier version of the compact hybrids that make such sense here (everywhere?). The driving was more edgy than we had grown accustomed to with Leel but not too stressful.</p>

<p>We stopped a little out of Ella, at a waterfall that seemed to be one of Ella's recognised attractions. But waterfalls in the tropics are, in my experience, often underwhelming. I recall a train ride from Mumbai down to Goa, thirty plus years ago, when the locals rushed excitedly to one side of the train to view a trickle of water down a rock on the steep hillside above. Today's version was a little more worthy of the title 'waterfall' but not spectacular. Maybe I'm getting jaded.</p>

<p>Some of the drive was along roads I had cycled a few weeks ago. It was hard to appreciate the heat outside with the benefit of AC inside the car but I soon remembered when we stopped for petrol and, even if I didn't get out of the car, lowered the window. Later, I recognised a stand of trees where I had stopped to readjust my handlebars by some sleeping dogs before reluctantly heading back out into the sunshine. I pointed out to Bev the steep rough concrete track up to a country lane I took to cut the corner between two perpendicular roads on my way to Buttala.</p>

<p>Our young driver didn't want to take his precious low-slung vehicle down the last fifty metres to our 'hotel'. Dirt but level. Kids these days... So we hauled our gear, not that there was much of it, and met our hostess Sureka halfway. A strong-looking young woman, around thirty, she cheerfully took command of our luggage. We were lead across an impeccably swept garden of palms to a typical concrete building (hardly a cabana but no complaints), up the stairs to a large verandah and a very comfortable room. In front of the verandah was a dried-out lagoon. (There was still water to our right. And birds.) Across the lagoon was a barrier, forty or fifty metres, of mangrove. We could hear the sea pounding on the far side.</p>

<h5>
  	4th March, 2024. Rukewa
</h5>

<p>In the morning we watched a peacock strut his stuff, from our verandah, before doing a loop along the beach.</p>

  alt="bird feeding"

<p>The beach was (almost) deserted. There was a young couple, sunbathing, who gathered their belongings and left when we arrived. Coincidental, I'm sure. No breeze yet and the sun was hot, the air thick. Faint tracks criss-crossed the loose sand above the high tide mark. I took them to be turtle tracks. Baby turtles. A fenced area protected the turtle eggs from being disturbed; we learned later that the eggs were collected and reburied safely behind the fence. </p>

<p>The sea looked powerful, and we had been warned of undertow and riptides. There was supposedly a path back to the road that led to our Pearl Cave Cabanas room and we stumbled around in the soft sand for a while looking for it. Plush-looking cabanas lined the beach further along and people were quietly enjoying breakfast. We were just an elderly couple stumbling by, lost, and not worthy of their attention.</p>

  alt="deserted beach"

<p>We came back around the other side (the wet end) of the lagoon. Separated from the sea by not very much, the lagoon is rain fed and fills up during the rainy season. </p>

  alt="lagoon birds"

<p>It didn't look like we could traverse the length of the lagoon back to Pearl Cave Cabanas so we went back out to the lane. Although our place feels pretty isolated, just a couple of rooms and a restaurant that no one but guests seems to frequent, there are clearly many similar properties in the area.</p>

<p>We were back for a late breakfast. That seemed to be enough exertion for one day. </p>

<p>After dinner, we planned to walk down to the beach to see the turtles, if any. But we were detained at dinner; Sureka asked us to wait ten minutes. It was her mother's birthday. Grandchildren (Sureka's nephews and nieces) helped string up a Happy Birthday banner. Sureka's father, whom we hadn't yet seen, arrived. And a cake. Of course, this took much more than ten minutes. (But the turtles would still be there the following night.)</p>

<p>Candles (less than 69) were lit on the cake and Mama (hygienically) fanned them out, and we all sang Happy Birthday in English. Mama cut a piece of birthday cake and took a bite,then held the piece out to each family member in turn for them to take a bite. We got separate pieces, whether because we weren't family or because we didn't have to share their piece, I'm not sure.</p>

<h5>5th March, 2024. Rukewa.</h5>

<p>Bev walked the few minutes to the Kapuhenwala Turtle Conservation Center to find out what the deal was with the turtles, while I balanced somewhat precariously on the hammock on the verandah. Everything happens about six-thirty so, even without the birthday party, we would have missed the 'event.'</p>

<p>We were on the beach at 6:15. Around thirty others were there. As it grew darker, a local gave a quick, fairly unintelligable, talk about their work. Two men went into the fenced enclosure and started digging with their hands until they uncovered a few turtles. 'Released,' the baby turtles about 6 cm in length, scurried seawards through the crowds of Westerners, finally making it to the sea. Hurrah!</p>

<p>Presumably, the baby turtles would make to the surface on their own, eventually, but this manipulation of exposing them meant the we crowds could keep the birds at bay (not that they seemed to be many around). If the turtles were later, dogs might get them. So the vaguely comical spectacle of crowds of adults and children around a tiny creature making its haphazard way to the crashing waves served some purpose. In addition to the donations most made to the organisation. The local had been turtle poachers until enlisted to preserve the turtles. Judging by the amount of faint tracks in the soft sand, many turtles still made it to the sea 'naturally.'</p>

<h5>6th March, 2024. Tangalle.</h5>

<p>We had decided upon taking the train for our return to Colombo. A little longer than a bus but much more comfortable, we thought. Online booking of tickets proved to be very simple &ndash; if only India could manage this! &ndash; but we had to go to an 'approved' station (possibly any station with a printer?) to pick up our tickets. We did it in advance but it might have been possible just before the train departure.  </p>

<p>We had a visit to Tangalle to pick up our ticket, for me to get a shave and a haircut, to get some cash, some honey... At the station, all it took was to show the email verification of the ticket purchase, my passport for ID, and our ticket was printed out very quickly.
</p>
<p>There were some nice murals on the approach road to the station. It was not Tangalle station (there isn't one!) but Beliatta.</p>

<p>Apparently, there are too many tuktuks in Sri Lanka. The government taxes them highly to reduce their numbers. It does not appear to have had much effect.</p>

<p>In the evening, we returned to the beach to view the 'hatch' again. The usually deserted beach was quite crowded for this spectacle.</p>

<h5>7th March. Rukewa.</h5>

<p>A nothing day. Hanging out. Reading a bit. In the hammock. A little wander but not far.</p>

<p>We saw the newly 69-years-old mother of Sureka in the lagoon, retrieving dead palm leaves that she had soaked overnight.</p>

  alt="Retrieving palm leaves from the lagoon"
/>

<p>Sureka's mother soaks the leaves, then weaves them into fronds for the roof of the restaurant. The roof is replaced each April, requiring about 500 fronds. Mum will be busy for a while.</p>

/>

<p>Seven 'boys' will come in April to reroof the restaurant, for a day. They earn 2,000 LKR each for their labours, about C$8.00.</p>

<h5>8th March - 10th March, Mirissa</h5>

<p>Sureka's mum was hard at work in the lagoon again, while we breakfasted. And while her husband played his new drums faintly in the distance. </p>

</div>
<p>A long tuktuk ride (much of it along road I had previously cycled) brought us through Matara to Mirissa for a couple of nights, primarily to try our luck with the whale-watching. Our highly-rated digs were not up to the standard of the Pearl Cave Cabanas but the family was lovely, in typical Sri Lankan style. I suspect the 13 year-old daughter, in short shorts and a T-shirt that didn't really try to cover her midriff, will prove to be a challengs.</p>
<Img
    src="/images/2024/03/2024-03-08-163327.jpg"
    alt="Mirissa"  
  />
<p>Wandering through town, it was easy to see where the young daughter's influence might originate. Westerners, often in revealing beach clothing, wandered the street whilst the more conservative locals, apparently unconcerned, went about their business. The beach caf&eacute;s had inflated prices, triple what we were used to.</p>

      alt="sunset"

<p>I hadn't planned on a whale-watching trip; it sounded crowded and expensive. But our homestay host had a more reasonable deal (of course) so I opted to keep Bev company. Even though it meant that I had to be up and ready to leave by 6:30 in the morning.</p>

      alt="whale watching boat"  
      caption="Our boat was not this crowded. But they did have lifebuoy rings."
  />
<p>Our host dropped us off at the departure point where we were quickly relieved of 30,000 LKR and asked not to tell anyone else how much (or how little) we had paid. There was a row of double-decker boats, ready and waiting to leave; whale-watching is definitely a big draw here.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant few hours on the water with plenty of room on our boat (about one-tenth full) to wander around. Being high on the boat magnified the effect of the waves but Bev, usually prone to sea-sickness, had no issues. </p>

<p>No whales were sighted but we did enjoy the antics, jumping out of the water and spinning, of dolphins. A solitary adult turtle was visible for a while, looking lonely all alone after seeing the school of hundreds of dolphins, but it quickly dove out of sight.</p>

<p>A spur of the moment decision: Bev says that maybe she should have an Ayurvedic massage while we're here, found a place highly-rated on Instagram and we both trundled off. It was very good, a Swedish sports massage, so we still haven't had an Ayurvedic massage. (Bev remembered one she had more than thirty years ago that left her invigorated for days so I may have to try before this trip is over.) We finished the day with an Indian meal. Vindaloo for me. Very, very spicy. At my limit. </p>

<p>Then a comfortable (first class air conditioned) and easy rail trip back to Colombo. Another spur of the moment decision: get out of the train at a station south of our destination and a tuktuk to Leisure Home in Nugegoda, also south of the Colombo railway station. A shorter tuktuk ride and a bit of time-saving &ndash; Madu was cooking dinner for us and the train was running late.</p>
