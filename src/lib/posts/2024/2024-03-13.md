<h5>
  	3rd March, 2024.<br/>
  	To Rukewa
</h5>

<p>Time for a break from travel and some lazy time before returning to Colombo for Bev's flight back to the UK and then home to Canada.</p>

<p>Will's son wasn't available to drive us to Rukewa, a location on the south coast that Bev had picked out. We had a ride with one of Will's sons' 'brother.' Not in the literal sense, I presume. A more stylish young man in a slightly sportier version of a compact hybrid that make a lot of sense here (and elsewhere). The driving was more edgy than we had grown accustomed to with Leel but not too stressful for us passengers.</p>

<p>We stopped a little out of Ella, at a waterfall that seemed to be one of Ella's recognised attractions. But waterfalls in the tropics are, in my experience, somewhat underwhelming. I recall a train ride from Mumbai down to Goa thirty years ago when the locals rushed excitedly to one side of the train to view a trickle of water down a rock on the steep hillside above. Today's version was a little more worthy of the title 'waterfall' but barely. Maybe I'm getting jaded.</p>

<p>Some of the drive was along roads I had cycled a few weeks ago. It was hard to appreciate the heat outside with the benefit of AC inside the car but I soon remembered when we stopped for petrol and, even if I didn't get out of the car, lowered the window. I recalled a stand of trees where I stopped to readjust my handlebars by some sleeping dogs. And a steep rough concrete track up to a country lane as I cut the corner between two perpendicular roads on my way to Buttala.</p>

<p>Our young driver didn't want to take his precious low-slung vehicle down the last fifty metres to our 'hotel'. Dirt but level. Kids these days... So we hauled our gear, not that there was much of it, and met our hostess Sureka halfway. A strong-looking young woman, around thirty. We were lead across an impeccably swept garden of palms to a building, up the stairs to a large verandah and a very comfortable room. In front of the verandah was a dried out lagoon, although there was still some water to our right. And birds. Across the lagoon was a barrier, forty or fifty metres of mangrove, and we could hear the sea pounding into the sandy beach on the far side.</p>

  	4th March - 8th March, 2024.<br/>
  	Rukewa
</h5>

<p>In the morning we watched a peacock strut his stuff, from our verandah, before doing a loop along the beach.</p>

<p>The beach was (almost) deserted. There were a couple of sunbathers who gathered their belongings and left when we arrived. Coincidental, I'm sure. No breeze yet and the sun was hot. Tracks criss-crossed the sand that I took to be turtle tracks. Baby turtles. A fenced area protected the turtle eggs from being disturbed; we learned later that the eggs were collected and reburied safely behind a fence. </p>

<p>The sea looked powerful, and we had been warned of undertow and riptides. There was supposedly a way back to the road that led to our Pearl Cave Cabanas room and we stumbled around in the soft sand for a while looking for it. Plush-looking cabanas lined the beach further along and people were quietly enjoying breakfast. </p>

<p>We came back around the other side (the wet end) of the lagoon. Separated from the sea by not very much, the lagoon is rain fed and fills up during the rainy season, we were told. </p>

<p>It didn't look like we could traverse the length of the lagoon back to Pearl Cave Cabanas so we went out to the road. Although our place seems pretty isolated, just a couple of rooms and a restaurant, there are clearly many similar places in the immediate area.</p>

<p>We were back for a late breakfast. That seemed to be enough exertion for one day. </p>

<h5>6th March, 2024. Tangalle.</h5>

<p>We had a visit to Tangalle to pick up our railway ticket to Colombo, for me to get a shave and a haircut, to get some cash, some honey... There were some nice murals.</p>

<p>Apparently, there are too many tuktuks in Sri Lanka. The government taxes them highly to reduce their numbers. It does not appear to have had much effect.</p>

<p>In the evening, we returned to the beach to view the 'hatch' again. The usually deserted beach was quite crowded for this spectacle.</p>

<h5>8th March - 10th March, Mirissa</h5>
<p>A long tuktuk ride brought us to Mirissa for a couple of nights, primarily to try our luck with the whale-watching. Our highly-rated digs were not up to the standard of the Pearl Cave Cabanas but the family was lovely, in typical Sri Lankan style. I suspect the 13 year-old daughter, in short shorts and a T-shirt that didn't really try to cover her midriff, will prove to be a challengs.</p>
<p>Wandering through town, it was easy to see where the young daughter's influence might originate. Westerners, often in revealing beach clothing, wandered the street whilst the more conservative locals, apparently unconcerned, went about their business. The beach caf&eacute;s had inflated prices with soft drinks at up to three times usual prices. </p>
<p>I hadn't planned on a whale-watching trip; it sounded crowded and expensive. But our homestay host had a more reasonable deal (of course) so I opted to keep Bev company. Even though I had to be up and ready to leave by 6:30 in the morning. Early starts are not my strong suit.</p>
<p>Our host dropped us off at the departure point where we were quickly relieved of 30,000 LKR and asked not to tell anyone else how much (or how little) we had paid. There was a row of double-decker boats, ready and waiting to leave; whale-watching is definitely a big draw here.</p>
<p>We had a very pleasant few hours on the water with plenty of room on our boat (about one-tenth full) to wander around. No whales were sighted but we did enjoy the antics, jumping out of the water and spinning, of dolphins. A solitary turtle was visible for a while, but it quickly dove out of sight.</p>
