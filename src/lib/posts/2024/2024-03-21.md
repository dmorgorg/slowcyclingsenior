<h5>
  	13th March, 2024.
  	Nugegoda - Negombo<br/>
    (47.3 km, 143 m, 988.7 km to date)
</h5>

<p>I was on the road before nine and through the city by ten. It could have been worse. No excessive or badly behaved traffic, alongside waterways frequently, or narrow lanes through poorer parts of the city. Then I crossed a larger river exiting into the ocean and was free of Colombo. For a while.</p>

<p>This didn't mean that I was immediately into pristine countryside. Fishing is the business here, boats trundling up and down a canal that was parallel to the nearby ocean, stalls along the canal, chopping up and selling freshly caught fish. There were three large pelicans patiently bobbing in the canal by one. Plenty of egrets, too, waiting for scraps.</p>

</div>

<p>My route followed this canal for a while, due north, not far from the coast. Easy going, but the heat took some getting used to again. That month with Bev has softened me up! My legs don't feel strong, shade looked inviting,... The "feels like 38<sup>o</sup>C" seemed close to the mark.</p>

<p>According to the map, I was on a narrow strip of land with the ocean on my left and a lagoon to my right. Housing along both sides of the road meanth I saw little of either. Sideroads hinted at what lay beyond but I didn't feel like I had the energy for unnecessary detours. </p>

<p>I arrived at my lodgings in Negombo a few minutes shy of two o'clock. A cool shower and a lie down... Then a hobble (my left ankle and right Achilles' tendon seem to dislike me being back on the bike) to a Thai restaurant where the food tasted surprisingly Sri Lankan. And the mosquitoes attacked my ankles - but I had some Ben's industrial strength Deet with me.

  	14th March, 2024.
  	Negombo - Chilaw<br/>
    (46.0 km, 121 m, 1034.7 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Still heading north, but more exposed to the sea. Less shade but more breeze. The saddle isn't feeling any softer but I hadn't thought that it would. My Komoot generated route wanted me to shifted to a parallel route between the fairly quiet road I was on and the beach but I missed the turn. I turned around and rode back, and missed it again. Another 180 to get me northbound, I spied a short, narrow, sandy track with fishing boats and the ocean beyond. Another 180 (the locals, selling their fresh and dried fish, must have thought I'd been in the sun too long as I passed some of them for the fourth time in a few minutes). </p>

<p>No road, lane or track to be found. Just soft sandy beach, some fishing boats, and a dyke of rocks that looked as though they had been placed to reduce erosion. So I used the opportune shade offered by the track to adjust the angle of my handlebars. </p>

<p>Then Bev messaged me to let me know she was awake, in London. We had a video chat. Lovely. </p>

<p>A young fisherman came out of his rudimentary home to sit on a small flat boat to make a phone call. It didn't seem that he could speak but was communicating with a hand signal by video. Not sign language that I recognised. Then a small girl game out to join him, looking at me with large, dark eyes. Her father, if that's who he was, returned my smile. All good.</p>

<p>Back to the road and continuing north towards my destination at Chilaw. Slow, plodding progress. Nica and flat, a little wind, the occasional tempting hotel as I got closer.</p>

<p>A day along the A03 road. Traffic aplenty. Just a matter of getting on with it, getting it done. But I still managed to procrastinate, leaving my unexceptional hotel just before ten. Then, a couple of hours later, I stopped at a salon for a shave. The (open) advertised air conditioning but that was not entirely accurate. The big bearded barber was busy so I took a chair. There was just a hole where the rear door might once have been and a corrugated asbestos roof so air conditioning would have had its work cut out for itself. A fan? Usually, but in this case it was lying dormant on the floor. I began to regret my procrastination as I gently perspired. After a while, I didn't feel I could just walk out &ndash; and I did want a shave. The barber pulled a chair over to the rear opening and indicated that I should sit there, where there was a little bit of a breeze. Ah, the air conditioning.</p>

<p>Worth the wait. It was a good, close shave.</p>

<p>According to booking.com, Puttalam didn't offer much choice in accommodation. I settled on the Taj Residence (US$27, so pricier than usual). Reviews were quite negative: a couple of cyclists thought the staff were too lazy to provide clean sheets, another guest complained about the absence of cold water (not really an issue; the cold is rarely cold, having warmed up to the outside temperature in an elevated tank). In contrast, I was pleasantly surprised: a big room, a comfortable bed, clean sheets and space for my bike in the room itself. An adjoining burger joint had cricket on the TV. What's not to like?</p>

<h5>16th March, 2024. Puttalam.</h5>

<p>My thighs were getting tender, the muscles bruised from three days of pedalling. My bottom was tender from the saddle, and some of my skin in my groin was painful from chafing. A rest day hanging out in the room seemed a good plan.</p>

<p>I paid for an extra night, walked the 600m down to the lagoon and a restaurant. Curry and rice for breakfast, and a cup of tea, before a walk along the lagoon until it just felt too hot and I made my way back to the luxury of an air-conditioned room. The temperature does seem to have edged up a little with the weather app telling me it "feels like 38<sup>o</sup>C again. That's 100<sup>o</sup>F so I feel I deserve to find it warm. Back in the saddle tomorrow.
