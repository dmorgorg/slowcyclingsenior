<h5>
  	17th March, 2024.
  	Anuradhapura -  Andiyapuliyankulam<br/>
    (78.8 km, 353 m, 1244.9 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Rest days are all very well but they go too quickly. They're over before your body has had time to recover. I'm sure there is some recovery, mentally at least, but when you get back on the bike it's hard to actually feel the benefit. I felt sluggish, uninspired and a trifle intimidated by the prospect of another long day in the sun and saddle. </p>

<p>I was back into padded cycling shorts to see if chafed less than my regular underwear and a little extra comfort wouldn't go amiss.</p>

<p>I hope I'm not tempting fate too much by stating this but my knees have been relatively painless so far, since Colombo, on the northern part of my tour. My ankle and Achilles have been giving no trouble on the bike, either, although they are still problematic when I am walking on anything other than level, smooth ground. As is my right knee. Overall, though, I am quite pleased.</p>

<p>There were the usual slew of motorcyclists who fell in beside me and asked my country, my name, where I was going, "by bicycle!" One such encounter made me smile: </p>

<blockquote>
  "Your country?"<br/>
  "Canada"<br/>
  "Ah, cannabis legalise!"
</blockquote>

<p>I followed my usual pattern of not committing myself too far ahead and hadn't booked accommodation. The plan was to get close to Wilpattu, maybe go back to the Ceylon Resort which appeared to have a vacancy. But there were plenty of places to stay, if need be, around the park entrance.</p>

<Img

  caption="More unfulfilled promises"
/>

<p>But by the time I reached the Wilpatu turnoff I figured I had enough gas in the tank to go further, to maybe even reach Anuradhapura. I made it, just as it was getting dark. I had booked back into the Amsterdam Tourist Rest, which took some finding because Google directs one to what is roughly the rear of the hotel property but there is no sign or access from that location. When I found the entrance, there was some issue &ndash; something to do with noisy Vietnamese guests &ndash; so the proprietor led me 600 m to another property he owned and was slowly readying for business. Also, his wife was ill so no dinner would be available. It was a very pleasant, comfortable and peaceful location. I was provided with a bucket and soap to do laundry when I declined the lovely lady's service, and a drying rack was brought to the veranda outside the building. As was a fresh lemon juice from their tree. Very nice. Then, I visited a nearby restaurant. And treated myself to a beer. Two, actually.</p>

  	18th March, 2024.
  	Puttalam - Anuradhapura<br/>
    (77.6 km, 486 m, 1166.1 km to date)
</h5>

<p>I'm heading back to the coast, at Mannar, having taken a jog inland to get around the leopards and elephants of Wilpattu park. I know little about the route but I'm sure it'll be fine...</p>

<p>Pleasant cycling out of town, around reservoirs, with views of some of the stupas that make Anuradhapura a World Heritage Site. I was asked for my tourist ticket at one spot but explained I was heading to Mannar and was provided with a smile and a "Safe journey, sir."</p>

<p>I took the road to the right (in the photograph below) and soon found that that was a wrong move; I should have ridden on the dirt track, along the side of another lake. So I returned and found the route, beside a magnificent tree. After a while alongside and around the lake, I seemed to be heading back towards Anuradhapura. The track deteriorated, and re-routed me onto paths that showed up on all my maps (Wahoo, Komoot, LocusPro, Google &ndash; presumably, they are all accessing the same open source mapping?) into pastures. And then stop being paths at all. Mmm. I decided to stay on the larger of the options, between the fields rather than through them, mildly confused but hoping it would all work out. My directional sense wanted me to go one way,  and my route on the cycle computer wanted me to go in another. I went one way (my way), then turned around. And came back to this magnificent tree. I've been here before, I realised, never one to miss a trick.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/03/2024-03-18-104836.jpg"
  alt="a magnificent, memorable tree"
  caption="A memorable tree"
/>

<p>I had gone around in a circle, and my route now lay back along the red dirt trail I had previously taken. And then to take a right turn that I hadn't noticed on my first lap. This time I decided to stick with the road I'd abandoned what seemed like ages earlier (but was probably only 45 minutes or so). So onto the tarmac. A motor-cyclist fell in beside me but this one didn't ask my country.</p>

<blockquote>
  "Problem?"
  <br/>
  "No, no problem" I replied.
  <br/>
  "You come this way twice? Why?"
  <br/>
  "Yes, I made a mistake."
  <br/>
  "Why?"
</blockquote>

<p>I had no answer for that, apart from a shrug. He turned around; he'd just been checking that all was OK with the crazy foreigner. </p>

<p>A while later I made another wrong turn, onto a new road. It was not on any of the maps I had. (The road I should have taken was a hundred metres further on.) No harm done and hardly any time lost. I do wonder what locals make of old tourists on bikes, riding in the heat of the day, and frequently turning around! </p>
<p>Some locals asked me where I was going but the place I mentioned made no sense to them. Later, school children also seemed unconvinced by my direction, and didn't know the place I was aiming for. Finally I got the message when a couple of farmers on motor-cycles told me I shouldn't (or couldn't?) proceed because of elephants on the road. (I wanted to see elephants on the road, of course, but it seemed that I was the only one who did.) One of the farmers, with the aid of Google translate, explained the situation, rode back with me to a short cut, and pointed me off in the direction of the new road I had abandoned an hour or more earlier.</p>

<Img
  src="/images/2024/03/2024-03-18-151201.jpg"

<p>It was getting later now and I was still on quiet, back-country roads through a sparsely populated rural landscape. Not prime accommodation country. Nothing showed up on Booking.com or on Google. I pedalled on. And reached an A-road, the main road to Mannar. I asked at a roadside stall about accommodation and the not unsurprising reply was "Mannar," another full day away. Then the proprietor paused for minute and mentioned a big bridge in 13 kilometres, then a lane on the left, and maybe rooms.</p>

<p>On I went, past army camps. I asked a sentry about hotels, and his officer came over, and considered my question. "Military hotel" he said, pointing down the road in the direction I was going. </p>

<p>And then, pretty close to 13 km on from where the stall proprietor had mentioned a possibility, was a bridge. Not a big one, by any means, but definitely a bridge. And a sign that read "River Edge Leisure." A sweeping driveway circled a grassy area where a man was holding a hose. In front of what looked like a bungalow.</p>

<div class="w-80">
  <Img
    src="/images/2024/03/riveredgeleisure.jpg"
    alt="sign for hotel"

</div>

<blockquote>
  "Room?"<br/>
</blockquote>
  Sideways head shake, the south Asian nod.
  Pause. He was going to make me work for it.
<blockquote>"Room?"</blockquote>
  Sideways nod.<br/>
  <blockquote>
    "How much?"<br/>
    "AC?"<br/>
  </blockquote>
  I shrugged; it really wasn't that important. A room was what I needed. He got out his phone, made a call, and passed it to me. To speak with someone with better English, an officer, I presumed. There were AC rooms, a bungalow for 6000 LKR and a more basic room for 5000 LKR. Somewhere to sleep!

<p>I wheeled my bike around to the back of the building and looked at the bungalow. Very nice. I checked out the other room, in the main building (which seemed to comprise two bedrooms with a sitting area between, open front and back). A large room, a double and single bed, and a bathroom with a fish tank for a window. Yes, this would do nicely.</p>

<p>The soldier &ndash; a sergeant &ndash; who had been watering the grass (not in formal uniform but in what appeared to be off-duty blue trackpants and t-shirt) brought me a cup of tea. I asked about dinner. Middle of nowhere but these soldiers have to eat. A major called me back as asked what I wanted to eat. Whatever was easy. Chicken curry, dahl, spicy beetroot curry and rice arrived around 8:00 pm.</p>

<p>A strange place, for sure. Perhaps provided for high-ranking visitors to the nearby military camps?</p>

<p>Warm today. The weather map for Anuradhapura showed 37<sup>o</sup>C, "feels like 39<sup>o</sup>C"</p>

<p>A varied day, not without its challenges, but splendid.</p>

<p>A cup of tea to start the day. An army camp on the left of the road, almost adjacent to my accommodation. Samosas of some sort not far along the road.</p>

<p>I was making good time, and expected to be in Mannar early. But I hadn't found anything particularly enticing about Mannar, and the accommodation looked only average &ndash; I'm clearly getting spoilt! Bev mentioned there were more spinner dolphins here but nothing came up online about them, or any way to see them. This, combined with the fact that there was a long stretch (two days, at least) to Jaffna or Point Pedro from Mannar, made me reconsider my route.</p>

<p>Instead of going in to Mannar, and then back out again a day or two later, I could cut the corner and start heading north. No reason not to. I did trade tarmac for red rocky double-track through pretty barren countryside for a while until I joined the Mannar to Jaffna route.</p>

<p>This was the third of three consecutive long days, and my energy levels were depleted. At every place where there was a human being I could converse with, I asked about a 'hotel' or 'rooms.' I received blank stares in return, or a hand pointing back down the way I'd come and the word "Mannar."</p>

<p>I was not far from the coast, just a couple of kilometres in places, and the wind wasn't very helpful. The clock seemed to be turning faster than my pedals. A man, where I stopped for water and a sugary drink again had no ideas, then mentioned a bar. Somewhere ahead. Nothing too promising. </p>

<p>A religious gathering of some sort seemed to be in progress in the middle of nowhere, and many people were walking along the road either towards it or away from it. It was late in the day and they were not wearing their working in the fields attire, more their "Sunday Best." I asked a trio of ladies about a hotel and one, smiled, nodded and indicated it was just ahead.</p>

<p>And there it was. The Green Line, Bar and Guests! In I went, only to be told, very unpleasantly, that they were full. People were drinking and staggering about. Damn!</p>

<p>The sun was only a couple of fingers above the horizon and I had no alternative but to proceed, through Vellankulam &ndash; just a small cluster of streets on the map &ndash; and into the countryside and darkness ahead. It looked like I'd be heading into the fields to lie down for the night. For a moment, I regretted not carrying a sleeping pad and a bivvy bag to keep the snakes and insects away. </p>

<p>At an army and police checkpoint at the far end of Vellankulam, I again asked about somewhere to sleep. They pointed back down the road, and I told them that the Green Line was full. As always, the people I was speaking to  had a varying and limited amount of English so I was never sure whether I was getting my message across. But a couple of phone calls and rooms miraculously freed up back at the Green Line. Five kilometres back down the road in the gathering darkness to where I was greeted much more graciously than the first time. A room under renovation was quickly, but rudimentarily, cleaned and I had somewhere to lie down for the night. A shower even. And some passable fried rice with a beer to get it down.</p>

  	Vellankulum - Point Pedro<br/>
    (84.2 km, 180 m, 1410.0 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Not the best of nights but I was the first to admit that it could have been much worse. Kottu for breakfast and back on the empty road. I had a sore rear end, bruised even, from the last three days. Despite padded shorts. I stopped frequently to stand, and rest. Other bits were going numb, too, so the rests served dual purpose. </p>

<p>The countryside became more wooded which slowed my progress by providing regular places to take advantage of the shade. It was while I was standing (to relieve my sore parts), in the shade, looking at my phone, that I bicycle came to a halt on the other side of the road. A local bike but ridden by a young Western woman in a short skirt. She came over to share the shade.</p>

<p>She had left Jaffna this morning and was hoping to make it to Mannar, donate the bike somewhere, and get a bus or buses to Negombo where she had a chaperoning job for a week or so. Young, entitled schoolkids from Dubai. She'd had a couple of these jobs, with two week breaks between so had done a cycle trip. About 60 km/day &ndash; not bad for a heavy single speed bike. But I suspected this day would be further (Jaffna to Mannar is about 120 km). Maybe she'll end up in the Green Line Bar and Guest? A Brit who has lived in Siem Reep for the last few years.</p>

<p>I joined the main road to Jaffna over the bridge, and then left it, heading directly to Point Pedro. Pretty open countryside with a prevailing headwind that has had the width of the Indian Ocean to pick up speed.</p>

<p>My hotel has a fairly impressive front gate. I've noticed this is a bit of a thing in Point Pedro. Here's another, a more spectacular version. Protecting a very stylish newly-constructed home.</p>

<p>Then off to the lighthouse to revisit the most northern post box on the island.

<p>A man approached for a chat &ndash; "Your country?" etc. &ndash; but I suspect his motive was to inform me that he was the proud owner of the boat in the background.</p>

<p>I posted a selfie to FB of me at the northern letter box. When I returned to the hotel, there was a comment from my friend Ben asking if I was at Akkamai Point and including a map. I looked more closely &ndash; this point certainly looked to be to the north of point claiming to be northernmost. Mmm... Well, too late to do anything about it now - I'd had enough gallivanting around in the heat.

<p>Maybe not! I awoke feeling definitely unrested and decided on another day in Point Pedro. I could get to the bottom of the top of the island mystery! Had dosai and chicken curry for breakfast, then headed west along the coastal road. Not far...</p>

<p>The north of the island is the Tamil area. It did have a more Indian feel to it, including more unsightly discarded garbage, less apparent in Sinhala areas. There was still plenty of evidence that the Portuguese had been here, too. Many (or most?) of the fishers, and there families, appeared to be Catholic.
