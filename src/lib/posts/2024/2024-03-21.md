<h5>
  	17th March, 2024.
  	Anuradhapura<br/>
    (78.9 km, 353 m, 1245.0 km to date)
</h5>

<p>Rest days are all very well but they go too quickly. They're over before your body has had time to recover. I'm sure there is some recovery, mentally at least, but when you get back on the bike it's hard to actually feel the benefit. I felt sluggish, uninspired and a trifle intimidated by the prospect of another long day in the sun and saddle. I was back into padded cycling shorts to see if chafed less than my regular underwear and a little extra comfort wouldn't go amiss.</p>

<p>I hope I'm not tempting fate too much by stating this but my knees have been relatively painless so far, since Colombo. My ankle and Achilles have been giving no trouble on the bike, either, although they are still problematic when I am walking on anything other than level, smooth ground. As is my right knee. Overall, though, I am quite pleased.</p>

<p>There were the usual slew of motorcyclists who fell in beside me and asked my country, my name, where I was going, "by bicycle!" One such encounter made me smile: </p>

<blockquote>
  "Your country?"<br/>
  "Canada"<br/>
  "Ah, cannabis legalise!"
</blockquote>

<p>I followed my usual pattern of not committing myself too far ahead and hadn't booked accommodation. The plan was to get close to Wilpattu, maybe go back to the Ceylon Resort which appeared to have a vacancy. But there were plenty of places to stay, if need be, around the park entrance.</p>

<p>But by the time I reached the Wilpatu turnoff I figured I had enough gas in the tank to reach Anuradhapura. It would be my longest day since started the 'northern leg' of my cycle tour and I made it, just as it was getting dark. I had booked back into the Amsterdam Tourist Rest, which took some finding, because Google directs one to what is roughly the rear of the hotel property but without a sign or access. There was some issue with the room at the place I'd booked so the proprietor led me 600 m to another property he owned and was slowly readying for business. A very pleasant and peaceful location. Dinner was not available, at either place, so I visited a nearby restaurant. And treated myself to a beer. Two, actually.</p>

  	18th March, 2024.
  	Puttalam - Anuradhapura<br/>
    (77.6 km, 486 m, 1166.1 km to date)
</h5>

<p>I'm heading back to the coast, at Mannar, having taken a jog inland to get around the leopards and elephants of Wilpattu park. I know little about the route but...</p>

<p>Pleasant cycling out of town, around reservoirs, with views of some of the stupas that make Anuradhapura a World Heritage Site. I was asked for my tourist ticket at one spot but explained I was heading to Mannar and was provided with a "Safe journey, sir."</p>

<p>I took the road to the right, and soon found that was wrong; I should have ridden on the dirt along the side of another lake. So I returned and found the route, beside a magnificent tree. After a while alongside the lake, I seemed to be heading back towards Anuradhapura. The track deteriorated, and rerouted me onto paths that disappeared into pastures. Mmm. I decided to stay on the larger of the options, thoroughly confused but hoping it would work out despite my directional sense wanting to go one way and my route on the Wahoo cycle computer sending me another. I went one way (my way), then turned around. And came back to this magnificent tree. I've been here before, I realised, never one to miss a trick.</p>

<p>My route was back along the red dirt trail (and to take a right turn that I hadn't even noticed) but this time I decided to stick with the road I'd abandoned what seemed like ages before (but was probably only 45 minutes or so). So onto the tarmac. A motor-cyclist fell in beside me but didn't ask my country.</p>

<blockquote>
  "Problem?"
  <br/>
  "No, no problem" I replied.
  <br/>
  "You come this way twice?"
  <br/>
  "Yes, I made a mistake."
  <br/>
  "Why?"
</blockquote>

<p>I had no answer for that, apart from a shrug. He turned around; he'd just been checking that all was OK with the crazy cyclist. </p>

<p>A while later I made another wrong turn, onto a new road. This road was not on the map any of the maps I had. The road I was aiming for was a hundred metres further on. No harm done and hardly any time lost. Some locals asked me where I was going but the place I mentioned made no sense to them. Later, school children seemed unconvinced by my direction, and didn't know the place I was aiming for. Finally I got the message when a couple of farmers on motor-cycles told me I shouldn't (or couldn't?) proceed because of elephants on the road. (But I wanted to see elephants on the road, of course, but I was the only one who did.) One of the farmers, with the aid of Google translate, explained the situation, rode back with me to a short cut, and pointed me off in the direction of the new road I had abandoned an hour or more earlier.</p>
