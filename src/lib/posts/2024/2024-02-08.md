<div class="caption">Entrance to Buttala</div>

<p>At the suggestion of Pat and Julie, I decided upon a day trip to a large freestanding Buddha, the highest in Sri Lanka. An extra day in Buttala was no issue, and even I couldn't avoid all the cultural sites!</p>
<p>Narrow lanes outside of town through little villages, then into more open countryside and an old Buddhist temple.</p>

<p>Then more pleasant, quiet riding (with a stop at a little supermarket for popsicles) on to the Buddha statue, secreted away in a wooded parkland setting. I had been charged to go into the temple earlier (500/-) but this more impressive location was free.</p>

<p>I had the place pretty much to myself. But not for long...</p>

<p>And then, just as suddenly, I had the place to myself again.</p>

<p>And a beautiful ride back to Buttala</p>

<p>A lovely day out. Marred only slightly by taking a detour on the way back and missing the store with the cold, juicy popsicles I'd enjoyed on the way out!</p>

  	4th February, 2024
  	<br />Buttala to Siyambalanduwa
</h5>
(54.6 km, 542 m, 447.5 km to date)

<p>Out of town and up some hills. </p>
<p>I saw Pat and Julie riding in the opposite direction, in search of a bakery. Their choice was closed &ndash; being Independence Day? &ndash; so they turned around and I headed them off at a coffee shop. Where I dallied for an hour. Procrastinating. </p>

<p>Sri Lanka is marking about 70 years of independence from the British today. Coincidentally, or appropriately, I rode past a mural depicting a Union Jack being stamped on...</p>

<p>I saw Pat and Julie riding in the opposite direction, in search of a bakery. Their choice was closed &ndash; being Independence Day &ndash; so they turned around and I headed them off at a coffee shop where I dallied for an hour. Procrastinating. </p>

<p>Although mainly downhill thereafter, there was still an unnecessary amount of uphill as I headed for the Nethmini Regency hotel along narrow ribbons of tarmac. </p>

<p>My Komoot app is less than 100% reliable with its routing. On the way out of Buttala, it had directed me through an army camp. So I just stayed on the main road until it rejoined the approved 'route.' This afternoon, a dirt track led of the narrow road I was on - and I followed as it changed from double track to a single path and then down to nothing in a plantation.</p>

<p>Some rain, and I finally arrived at the Nethmini Regency. Accommodation looked to be in short supply in this area so I had booked the Nethmini through hotels.com, an app I hadn't used before but the only one featuring a place to stay in this area.</p>
<p>The front desk couldn't find my reservation and made a phone call or two to (presumably) their boss. I showed them the charge on my Visa card account so that they knew I had paid but to no avail. More phone calls. Then the news: they don't work with booking.com or hotels.com and my charge would be refunded. Really? When and by whom? I had to pay cash for the room (the only good news about this was that the rate I was charged was a little over half the hotels.com rate). The hotel room was very nice, especially for the price, and the limited restaurant menu of fried rice or fried noodles was surprisingly adequate. It remains to be seen whether I end up paying half the expected charge for the night, or 1.5 times! </p>
