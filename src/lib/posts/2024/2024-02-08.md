<div class="caption">Entrance to Buttala</div>

<p>At the suggestion of Pat and Jules, I decided upon a day trip to a large freestanding Buddha, the highest in Sri Lanka. An extra day in Buttala was no issue, and I couldn't avoid all the sites!</p>
<p>Narrow lanes outside of town through little villages, then into more open countryside and an old Buddhist temple.</p>

<p>I had the place pretty much to myself. But not for long...</p>

<p>And then, just as suddenly, I had the place to myself again.</p>

<p>A lovely day out. Marred only slightly by taking a detour on the way back and missing the store with the cold, juicy popsicles!</p>
