<h5>
  	3rd February, 2024
  	<br />Day trip to the Buddha statue in Maligawila
</h5>
(38.9 km, 234 m, 392.9 km to date)

<div class="caption">Entrance to Buttala</div>

<p>At the suggestion of Pat and Julie, I decided upon a day trip to a large freestanding Buddha, the highest in Sri Lanka. An extra day in Buttala was no issue, and even I couldn't avoid all the cultural sites!</p>
<p>Narrow lanes outside of town through little villages, then into more open countryside and an old Buddhist temple.</p>

<p>Then more pleasant, quiet riding (with a stop at a little supermarket for popsicles) on to the Buddha statue, secreted away in a wooded parkland setting. I had been charged to go into the temple earlier (500/-) but this more impressive location was free.</p>

<p>I had the place pretty much to myself. But not for long...</p>

<p>And then, just as suddenly, I had the place to myself again.</p>

<p>And a beautiful ride back to Buttala</p>

<p>A lovely day out. Marred only slightly by taking a detour on the way back and missing the store with the cold, juicy popsicles I'd enjoyed on the way out!</p>

  	4th February, 2024
  	<br />Buttala to Siyambalanduwa
</h5>
(54.6 km, 542 m, 447.5 km to date)

<p>Out of town and up some hills. </p>

<p>Sri Lanka is marking about 70 years of independence from the British today. Coincidentally, or appropriately, I rode past a mural depicting a Union Jack being stamped on...</p>

  alt="Goodbye to the British"
/>

<div class="caption">So much for the Union Jack!</div>

<p>I saw Pat and Julie riding in the opposite direction, in search of a bakery. Their choice was closed &ndash; being Independence Day &ndash; so they turned around and I headed them off at a coffee shop where I dallied for an hour. Procrastinating. </p>

<p>Although mainly downhill thereafter, there still seemed an unnecessary amount of uphill as I headed for the Nethmini Regency hotel along narrow ribbons of tarmac. </p>

<p>My Komoot app is less than 100% reliable with its routing. On the way out of Buttala, it had directed me through an army camp. So I just stayed on the main road until it rejoined the approved 'route.' This afternoon, a dirt track led of the narrow road I was on - and I followed as it changed from double track to a single path and then down to nothing in a plantation.</p>

<p>Some rain, and I finally arrived at the Nethmini Regency. Accommodation looked to be in short supply in this area so I had booked the Nethmini through hotels.com, an app I hadn't used before but the only one featuring a place to stay in this area.</p>

<p>The front desk couldn't find my reservation and made a phone call or two to (presumably) their boss. I showed them the charge on my Visa card account so that they knew I had paid but to no avail. More phone calls. Then the news: they don't work with booking.com or hotels.com and my charge would be refunded. Really? When and by whom? I had to pay cash for the room (the only good news about this was that the rate I was charged was a little over half the hotels.com rate). The hotel room was very nice, especially for the price, and the limited restaurant menu of fried rice or fried noodles was surprisingly adequate. It remains to be seen whether I end up paying half the expected charge for the night, or 1.5 times! </p>

<h5>
  	5th February, 2024
  	<br />Siyambalanduwa to Ampara
</h5>
(62.4 km, 481 m, 509.9 km to date)

<p>Overcast and light drizzle after more serious rain before I got going. Down into town for freshly cooked eggs samsas (the local pronunciation for samosa, I think), then back up past the Nethmini Regency and onward, northward. </p>
<p>After about 15 km, I received a WhatsApp message from Julie; they had just checked into the Nethmini and were thanking me for the info on the hotel. They had had an early start, when it was still storming, and were calling it a day. It is not unusual for people to be finishing their day's riding while I'm still getting established on mine. </p>

<img
  src="/images/2024/02/2024-02-05-015808.jpg"
  alt="Lake view"
/>

<p>I rolled past the Elephant View Hotel; the name rang a bell but I couldn't place it (it had been mentioned by Pat and Julie as a possibility), by a pretty lake. There seems to be no limit to the bodies of water inland, supporting another fishing cottage industry but taking their catch from fresh water here. </p>

<p>Ampara didn't seem to have much in the way of hotels. I was looking at my phone, trying to figure out where The Monty Hotel was when a man, at the store I was paused in front of, asked if I needed help. I explained what I was doing and he turned up his nose at The Monty, and called a new nearby hotel for me. They sent someone down on a scooter to guide me in. A construction crew was installing metal handrails, with attendant noise and sparks from a grinder, when I arrived. The room was fine, the price reasonable, and dinner was offered. In the karaoke room. Although I was the only person in there. (Thankfully?)</p>

<h5>
  	6th February, 2024
  	<br />Ampara to Batticaloa
</h5>
(67.8 km, 219 m, 577.7 km to date)
  
<p>I was asked to sign the comments book as I paid up and checked. Mine was the only entry. Maybe I was the first guest? I also posed for the requested photos outside the hotel, alongside some of the staff, before pedalling away.</p>

<p>My Komoot-curated route out of town led me past the town dump. And I saw my first 'wild' elephant, though not in the best surroundings. It was a depressing sight.</p>

</div>
<div class="caption">Plastic doesn't seem to be digestible by elephants.</div>

<p>After the dump, the scenery was almost parklike with short cropped grass (upon which skinny cattle were grazing) with isolated trees, very different from the densely wooded jungle I had travelled through for the previous few days.</p>

<img

  alt="roadside shrine"

<p>Rice harvest seemed to be in full progress as the terrain changed to rice fields. Many of the roads had their surface repurposed to drying rice which was raked out on tarpaulins in the sun. Men and women shuffled up and down, feet deep in the rice, turning it over, exposing it to the sun. In other areas, the rice was still being harvested.</p>

  alt="drying rice"

<p>Komoot directed me along paths less travelled again, but pleasurably so. I followed a track alongside a grubby looking water channel for a while, with occasional cattle as potential road hazards. Maybe due to the heat, they couldn't be bothered to show much interest in those passing.</p>

<p>I didn't have to go all the way into Batticoloa, which was nice at the end of a day that seemed to have been sufficiently long and hot. I had my first view of the (eastern) ocean as I rode along a lightly populated peninsula to the hotel suggested by Pat and Julie. Suresh welcomed me and showed me to a pleasant enough room in time for me to shower and head out on my now unladen bike in search of dinner.</p>
