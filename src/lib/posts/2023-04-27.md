	<h5>
		April 22nd, 2023
		<br /> Dieppe, Normandie, to Forges-les-Eaux, Normandie
	</h5>
	(59.0 km, 234 m ascent, 223.3 km to date)
	<p>	
	(Note: The ascent does not count the long haul up from the ferry on disembarkation, since I was still half-asleep and didn’t turn on my computer!)
	</p>
	<p>
	A short night on the ferry but I managed some sleep. Not much. But some. It was barely light when I rolled off the ferry and puffed up the hill &ndash; there was only one way to go. If I had needed to navigate, I might have realised earlier that my computer was not on. It felt like a long climb but probably wasn’t… Then back down again, presumably to sea-level, whizzing through sleepy streets with no-one yet up and about. And then onto a cycle path, a pleasant riding surface and little to do but pedal. Out of town before I had a chance to find a coffee!
	</p>
	<p>
	The path led me on all day, simple riding, with little to occupy the mind. I came suddenly awake before veering totally off the trail and managed to regain control. Falling asleep whilst riding was a first more me, and a reminder that I hadn't had much sleep the night before. At the next bench I parked up, stretched out and caught up on some sleep.
	</p>
	<p>
	My first night in France was in a quiet, pleasant pink-stuccoed hotel in Forges-les-Eaux, Normandie. I stayed for two nights due to rain. And inertia. The second day was Sunday and their restaurant was closed, except the guests. It was a Gujerati family and it was curry for dinner. Very nice.

		April 25th, 2023
		<br /> Forges-les-Eaux to Gisors, Normandie
	</h5>
	(69.0 km, 639 m ascent, 292.3 km to date)
	<p>
	I rolled into this village and was immediately distracted by a magnificent abbey. Worth a stop and a few photographs but I really should have written down the name of the place!
	</p>
	<Callout>
	<strong>Reverse image search provided a location this few months later!</strong><p/> The village is Saint-Germer-de-Fly. This was a Benedictine abbey, founded in 661. The abbey church was built in the 12th century, in the Gothic style.

	<p>
	Deserted countryside with little traffic and virtually no people. Quiet, meditative, soothing. I could handle a lot of this :) Narrow farm roads, almost perfect. A little more sun would have made it ten out of ten.

	(14.5 km, 41 m ascent, 373.3 km to date)

    A rest day in a pleasant attic room. A grocery run into the nearby town of Ivry-la-Bataille and a pleasant lunch in the locals' lunchtime hangout. The forecast rain didn’t materialise until I arrived back at the mansard! With two bottles of cider to get me through the evening.

	<br /> Ferme de la Malmaison to Chartres, Centre-Val-de-Loire
</h5>
(71.8 km, 286 m ascent, 445.1 km to date)

Another noon start, waiting to the rain to clear. Which it did, a little earlier than forecast. Twenty kilometres of cycle-path through empty countryside, not far from the Eure. A few bucolic villages. Then, just as it was getting monotonous, low-traffic roads. Off the Avenue Verte now, heading southward to join the EuroVelo 3, or Pilgrim's Route, at Tours. Out of Normandie, too.

The sun came out and I got a little burnt. It was warmer, too. A perfect riding day apart from some headwind. Still very quiet, solitary. How I like it. Not that I was disappointed when it was over and I pulled into the hotel in Chartres. Cycle paths did a good job of hiding the built up suburbs and the entrance into the city was straightforward.

The following day was a rest-cum-culture day. A lazy wander around the city.
